"""Documentation that names things must name things that exist.

🔴 **Why this file exists.** An audit on 2026-09-05 found `README.md` and
`README.zh.md` advertising an MCP tool called `get_transcript`. `git log -S`
returns nothing: **it has never existed**, in any version, since the MCP server
was written. It had been in the README for six weeks.

That was not the only one. `docs/commands.md` said "8 tools" against 19, listed
six `db` subcommands against eight and four export formats against six, and
omitted five whole CLI commands. `docs/roadmap.md` gave the version as v1.3.1
while `__version__` read 1.4.0, and stated the schema as v18 on one line and
v17 on the next -- **directly above a warning it had written itself about
exactly that mistake in the version before**. `SKILL.md` -- which ships inside
the wheel, under the heading "do **not** invent flags beyond these" -- was
missing `--force-keyframes`.

Every one of those is prose asserting something checkable, and nothing was
checking. Prose does not rot faster than code; it rots at the same rate and
nobody notices, because there is no failing test to notice with. So these
assertions are executable now: the docs are read, the values are derived from
the code, and a mismatch is a red test rather than a reader's wasted afternoon.

Deliberately narrow: only claims that are **enumerable from the code** are
checked here. Prose describing intent, tradeoffs or history is not, and should
not be -- a gate that demanded exact wording would be reformatted into
uselessness within a month.
