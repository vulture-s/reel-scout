    The player shows a blank rectangle and says nothing, while the transcript,
    score and keyframes all come out normal. Chrome decodes what Safari will
    not, so the same library works for one viewer and not the next.

    This assertion started life as "anything but AV1" and that was too narrow:
    excluding av01 lets VP9 through, and VP9 was what the library was full of.

    Measured on a real iPad 2026-08-25, one variable at a time -- same clip,
    same server, only the video codec swapped:

        h264 + aac   plays        vp9 + aac    does NOT play
        h264 + opus  plays        vp9 + opus   does NOT play
                                  av1 + opus   does NOT play

    The video codec is the whole story; the audio codec is irrelevant. On the
    audited library that is 103 of 109 files unplayable (88 vp9+aac, 13
    vp9+opus, 2 av1+opus), while the av01 filter stayed green throughout.

    The earlier version of this docstring asserted a mechanism ("Safari decodes
    VP9 only inside WebM", "Opus in MP4 fails on Apple") that was platform lore,
    not measurement. The Opus half turned out to be false. Kept here as a
    reminder that the actionable rule -- name the codec you want -- never
    depended on the mechanism being right.

    So the preferred branches now name H.264 and AAC positively instead of
    naming one bad codec negatively — a denylist only ever excludes the codec
    somebody already got burned by.

    Both halves are asserted because either alone is a trap. Without the codec
    preference the default "best" keeps handing back VP9. Without the
    unconstrained tail, a video published only in VP9 or AV1 stops being
    ingestable at all — and a clip that will not play is still worth its
    transcript, keyframes and score.
