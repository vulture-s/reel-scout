# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **The sheet is fluid on desktop instead of a fixed 1240.**
  `clamp(1240px, 100vw - 100px, 1560px)` — never narrower than before, 50px of
  desk left at the sides, and it stops at 1560 because past that only the tables
  keep growing: prose, the score panel and the reweight card are all already at
  their own caps. Measured: at a 1512 display the sheet goes 1240 → 1412; at
  1920 it reaches the 1560 ceiling.

  The four differentiator cards needed a cap of their own — their column is half
  the sheet, so they tracked it up to 48 characters a line while the rest of the
  site sat at 43. Now 68ch like everything else. Orphan counts and kinsoku are
  unchanged from the typography pass (11 Chrome / 6 WebKit, 0 violations).

- 🔴 **Threads is now off by default (opt-in via `THREADS_USER_AGENT`).**
  The crawler only gets a post by presenting a search-crawler User-Agent —
  impersonating one — and Threads' `robots.txt` opens with "collection of data
  on Threads through automated means is prohibited unless you have express
  written permission", disallowing everything for agents it does not name.
  Until this change the package shipped with Googlebot as the default, so
  every install did that out of the box.

  Now the default is empty and the crawler refuses **before any request**
  (not even the rate limiter runs), with a message saying why and how to opt
  in. `docs/threads.md` gains an "Off by default" section stating the terms
  plainly and the limits of fair use: one hand-picked post at a time, never
  program-generated URL lists, schedules, search or profile pages; at scale,
  use the official API. If Threads stops serving that page, the answer is to
  stop — not to find a User-Agent that looks more like a browser. The site
  copy (home, how-it-works, honest list) says the same; the homepage no longer
  lists Threads among "URLs it eats directly".

  The shipped default is pinned by an AST test on the source rather than the
  runtime value, because config loads the project `.env` — a machine that has
  opted in would otherwise fail the check there and pass everywhere else.

- **The front page now renders the four differentiators and the five-signal
  reliability table.** Both were written, kept in sync with the code and never
  put on the page: `index.astro` declared them and the template never used them.
  Nothing failed — the build was green, and a source-level grep for their text
  found it, which is exactly why a platform-coverage gate also passed on copy
  nobody could see. A test now fails the build when a page declares a content
  array its template never references.

- **The page is wider: the sheet goes 1080 → 1240, the content column 964 →
  1124.** It gets its own site-only token (`--col-site`) rather than moving
  `--col-wide`, which `theme.py` shares with the inspector — widening the site
  through that token would have dragged the tool's layout with it. Body prose is
  unaffected because paragraphs carry their own measure (39–54 characters a
  line); the extra room goes to the tables and the reweight panel, which were
  the two things 964px was squeezing. Measured at 1440/1512/1920/1280/1024/768
  /390: no horizontal scroll anywhere, and the only line over 70 characters is
  the footer's licence credit.

- **The site now says it eats Threads links.** The crawler shipped in #153 and
  the front page still read "YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels or TikTok", so
  someone holding a Threads URL had no way to know. Stated with its shape
  intact: Threads does not go through yt-dlp — there is no extractor — it reads
  the post page itself, which means single posts only and no `browse`. A test
  pins it: a registered crawler the front page never names is a build failure.

- **The inspector's reweight panel now shows the weight total and the overall,
  matching the site.** Same reason as the site's panel, plus one the site did
  not have: the inspector *blanked* that line whenever the weights sat at
  default — the exact state that should read "weights total 100%". Now the sum
  and the overall show unconditionally and only the comparison against the
  stored score stays conditional: `weights total 100% · overall 6.8` at rest,
  `weights total 165% → rescaled to 100% · default 6.8 · yours 6.5 (-0.3)`
  after a drag, `weights total 0% · no overall` with everything at zero.
  Translated, so it reads the same in both locales. A difference that rounds to
  zero no longer prints as `(-0.0)`.

- **The site's reweight panel now shows the weight total and the running
  score.** The four sliders are each 0–100 and do not have to add up, so the
  panel was quietly rescaling to 100% and only saying so in prose above the
  controls. Now the footer line states it per drag: `權重總和 100% · 總分 6.8`
  when the sliders already add up, `權重總和 165% → 縮放 100% · 總分 6.5` when
  they do not. Showing only `100%` would read as "the sliders are locked";
  showing only `165%` would contradict the explanation — so both appear.
  Dragging everything to zero reads `權重總和 0% · 算不出總分`, because no
  dimension being valued is not a score of zero.

- **A Threads post is stored as a post, not just its first video** (schema
  v20). Rule, written out in `docs/threads.md`: the **first video is
  analyzed**, **photos are downloaded and stored**, **other videos are
  listed**; caption, the author's follow-up posts and engagement counts go to
  `post_meta` (counts with the time they were fetched — they are a snapshot).

  Any other video in the post can be analyzed on demand. In `reel-scout view`
  the clip's **Post** section shows every item, and a video with no analysis
  has a **queue analysis** button. The button writes one request row and
  nothing else — the viewer has no account layer, so it never runs the
  pipeline; `reel-scout pending --run` does, on the machine that has it. Each
  request becomes `analyze <post url>?media=N`, so the clip gets its own row,
  URL and id (`<code>#N`), and dedupe / `batch` / the queue need no change.
  A request is marked `done` only when the DB shows that row `analyzed`.

  Found while testing live, **not fixed here**: a clip with **no audio
  stream** fails transcription with `tuple index out of range`. It reproduces
  on a local file with no Threads code involved, so it is the transcriber's —
  but every video in one real carousel was silent, so it blocks those posts
  until it is fixed.

- **Threads posts: `analyze https://www.threads.com/...` now works** (post
  URLs and `/share/` links, `threads.com` and `threads.net`). yt-dlp has no
  Threads extractor, and the post code is not an Instagram shortcode in
  disguise — the same ID on `instagram.com/p/` is refused even with valid
  cookies while a known reel in the same call succeeds.

  What works is the post page itself: Threads serves browsers a login wall
  but serves search crawlers a server-rendered page whose JSON carries the
  whole post — direct mp4 URLs that download without cookies, plus caption,
  author, timestamp, engagement counts and the author's own follow-up posts.
  Measured on five real queued posts covering all three layouts videos live
  in (single video, carousel, text post with an inline video): 5/5 resolved
  and downloaded as h264.

  🔴 The whole thing rests on one assumption — which User-Agent gets the
  server-rendered page — so it lives in `THREADS_USER_AGENT`, not in the
  crawler, and a page with no post in it raises instead of returning an empty
  row. The day Threads stops serving it, this fails loud.

  One trap found only by running it live: the page streams a post as several
  fragments sharing an `id`, and the follow-up posts sit in a different
  fragment from the caption. Reading only the fragment with the post code
  returned zero follow-ups for a post that had one, with nothing failing.

  How the rest of the post (photos, other videos, caption, counts) is stored
  is the entry above. `batch` still does not pick up Threads links.

- **An official site: <https://vulture-s.github.io/reel-scout/>.** Before this
  the repository had no description, no homepage and no Pages — a tool that is
  on PyPI, documents nineteen MCP tools and ships a skill, with nowhere on
  GitHub that answers "how is this different from pasting the URL into an AI".

  Seven pages, thirteen routes, built with Astro and deployed by Actions. The
  doc pages render `docs/*.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` directly — those files stay
  the single source of truth and the site is just another place that reads
  them — through an **allowlist, not a glob**: "anything later dropped into
  `docs/` goes live" is the wrong default, because the next thing dropped in
  may be a private note.

  One page is worth naming: **誠實清單** (the honest list). It carries only
  limits that have actually been hit, each with what to do about it. "Problems
  you might have" are left out on purpose — those turn an honest list into a
  disclaimer, and nobody reads a disclaimer.

- **Paper.** The shell grows two fixed layers — an SVG `feTurbulence` fibre and
  ruled lines — shared by the viewer, the inspector, the take-home export and
  the site, so all four stay one surface. Only `--paper-col` differs (the tool
  is wide, the site is editorial).

  🔴 Two decisions here were reversed **by rendering them**, not by reading the
  code. The ruled lines first shipped scoped to a class that only the doc pages
  carried: present, invisible, effectively not done. And tables were first
  masked on the theory that row dividers and ruled lines would fight — but the
  library view *is* one full-width table, so masking it left the whole screen
  bare. Measured on paper: a ruled line at 8% sits 17/255 from the sheet while
  `--rule-soft` sits 36/255 away, so the dividers stay unambiguously louder.

### Fixed

- **Threads (and Doc-based `batch`) never worked on python.org macOS Python.**
  That installer ships without access to the system CA store until someone runs
  "Install Certificates.command", so every urllib HTTPS request failed with
  `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`. Found on the maintainer's M2 Max, where the Threads
  crawler had never once succeeded -- every earlier live test had run on Windows,
  whose Python reads the OS store. yt-dlp handles certificates itself, which is
  why IG / TikTok / YouTube never showed it.

  The two internet-facing urllib calls (Threads post pages, `batch` Doc export) now
  go through `reel_scout/utils/https.py`: a user-set `SSL_CERT_FILE` wins, else
  certifi's bundle (now a declared dependency), else the platform default.
  Verified on the affected machine: same Python, same URL -- plain `urlopen` fails,
  the helper returns 200.

- **Chinese line-breaking: orphan last lines, and two blocks with no measure
  cap.** Audited both engines across six pages and five widths by reconstructing
  every rendered line from per-character client rects. Two things came back
  clean and stay that way: kinsoku (no punctuation starting a line, no opening
  bracket ending one) is handled by the browser, 0 violations; and no Latin word
  or number is ever split. Two were not:

  `text-wrap: pretty` for the orphans — a last line holding one or two
  characters, 37 of them in Chrome and 40 in WebKit, almost all at phone width
  (「…零金／鑰。」「…判斷留給／人。」). Now 11 and 6.

  A 62ch cap on the subscribe box and the footer, which had no `max-width` at
  all. Widening the sheet to 1240 pushed them from 68 characters a line to 80,
  while capped prose stayed at 43 — the regression landed exactly on the two
  blocks nobody had set a limit for, and the subscribe box is on every page.
  Longest line on the site is now 44 characters, down from 90.

- **A clip with no audio stream crashed transcription** with
  `IndexError: tuple index out of range`. faster-whisper decodes through PyAV,
  which asks for audio stream 0 whether or not one exists. Found on a real
  Threads carousel whose three videos were all silent, and reproduced on a
  plain local file — so it was never a Threads problem; "no audio stream" was
  simply unhandled.

  Now the stream count is probed first. Zero streams → an empty transcript
  whose model reads `none:no-audio-stream` (so it is stored, not retried every
  run, and says why it is empty), Whisper is not called, and the clip goes on
  to keyframes, VLM and scoring — the real carousel clip now analyzes end to
  end. A probe that *fails* is not treated as silence: it still goes to
  Whisper, so an unreadable file keeps failing loudly instead of being
  recorded as "no speech".

- **The site said Threads could not be crawled, which stopped being true the
  moment the Threads crawler merged.** Rewritten to what is now the real
  limitation: it works by reading the server-rendered page Threads serves to
  search crawlers, so the User-Agent is the whole load-bearing assumption. The
  "use the Instagram URL instead" substitute is still dead, and that part stays.
  A test now pins the seam — a registered crawler plus a sentence on the limits
  page denying it is a build failure, because nothing else was watching for
  claims that should come *out* of that page.

- **The craft re-weighting sliders were painted in the browser's accent
  colour** — on a stock macOS install, a bright blue, on a shell whose own
  canon says it spends no colour at all. The tokens were right; nothing had
  told the control about them (`accent-color: var(--ink)`).

  It had been there long enough to be **in the screenshot used by both READMEs
  and the site's home page** — so the main piece of evidence for "this shell is
  monochrome" was a counter-example to it. The screenshot has been retaken, and
  its alt text now describes what the image actually contains rather than a
  bilingual pairing that is no longer visible in it.

- **Doc pages shipped two `<h1>` elements and a 404.** The page supplies a
  short title for the nav and each `.md` opens with its own long one; and the
  link rewriter only understood same-directory `.md`, leaving everything else
  "as written" — which for `../prompts/signal-reliability-cheatsheet.md` meant
  a guaranteed 404 rather than neutrality. Links now resolve in three classes
  (published → `.html`, other in-repo `.md` → GitHub, external → untouched),
  and the leading `h1` is demoted in the rehype pass.

  Both were found by opening the live page. Both are now executable checks:
  `site/test/links.test.mjs` plus two build-time assertions (one `h1` per page,
  no unresolved `.md` links).

## 1.4.2 — 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **The docs advertised an MCP tool that has never existed.** `README.md` and
  `README.zh.md` listed `get_transcript` among the read-side tools;
  `git log -S` returns nothing for it, in any version, since the MCP server was
  written. It had been there for six weeks.

  It was not alone. `docs/commands.md` said **8 tools against 19**, six `db`
  subcommands against eight, four export formats against six, and omitted five
  whole CLI commands. `docs/roadmap.md` gave the version as v1.3.1 while the
  code read 1.4.0, and stated the schema as **v18 on one line and v17 on the
  next — directly above a warning it had written itself about making exactly
  that mistake in the version before.** `SKILL.md`, which **ships inside the
  wheel** under the heading "do **not** invent flags beyond these", was missing
  `--force-keyframes`: a list that omits a real flag is worse than no list,
  because it makes the real one look invented.

  All corrected — and, more usefully, `tests/test_docs_are_current.py` now
  derives every one of those claims from the code and fails on a mismatch.
  Prose does not rot faster than code; it rots at the same rate and nobody
  notices, because there is no failing test to notice with. Verified by putting
  each of the six errors back: every one turns the gate red.

- **Six merged changes reached 1.4.0 with no changelog entry** — `mark` and
  its `clip_marks` table (**a whole schema step**, v13), URL-based clip
  identity, Apple-playable codec selection, transcripts outliving their media,
  near-miss BPM reporting, and evidence coverage in `stats`. Written into the
  1.4.0 section now, marked with the date they were recorded rather than
  backdated.

### Notes

- The 1.4.0 note "Schema v13 → v18" describes the repo's history, not an
  upgrade: **1.3.1 on PyPI shipped `SCHEMA_VERSION = 10`**, so a published-
  version upgrade runs v10 → v18. Both were tested on real backups; the line
  now says which is which.
- The gate is deliberately narrow: only claims **enumerable from the code** are
  checked. Prose about intent, tradeoffs and history is not, and must not be —
  a gate demanding exact wording would be reformatted into uselessness within
  a month. Its first two versions were too broad and flagged the roadmap's
  *correct* quotations of its own past errors; the fix was to give the current
  claim one authoritative line and leave the commentary around it free.
- Found by an independent read-only audit of 1.4.0 (2026-09-05): R8, R9.

- **`scores.model_used` recorded the backend, not the model — while `stats`
  grouped on it under a docstring promising the opposite.** All 115 locally
  scored rows in the library read `ollama`. The docstring on the aggregate
  says grouping is "on the exact `model_used` string, the finest grain that is
  actually correct: two local VLMs are no more comparable to each other than an
  agent is to either" — and every model that ever scored under one backend was
  pooled into a single yardstick, which is precisely what the column was added
  to prevent. Swapping `qwen2.5:14b` for `gpt-oss:20b` moved nothing on the
  page.

  The gap was only in the scorer: the ingest path already stamps
  `agent:<model>`, and `vision_descriptions.vlm_model`,
  `translations.engine`/`model` and `shot_labels.model` were all checked and
  are correct. New scores carry `<backend>:<model>` — the same shape, so a
  reader splits on the first colon whoever produced the row.

  ⚠️ **The 115 existing rows are left as they are.** A bare backend name is a
  readable "recorded before the model was"; backfilling it would mean inventing
  a fact that is not written down anywhere, and a wrong provenance is worse
  than a missing one.

### Notes

- The audit also flagged 1,077 `ocr_captions` rows with `engine='vlm'` and no
  model. Checked: those rows are re-read from `vision_descriptions.text_in_frame`
  at the same keyframe, and that table **does** record `vlm_model` — so the
  provenance is recoverable by join rather than lost. No column added; a second
  copy of a fact is a second thing that can drift from it.
- `BaseLLM` gained a `model` property, so a backend added later cannot quietly
  go back to recording only itself.
- Found by an independent read-only audit of 1.4.0 (2026-09-05): R7.

- **"This codec has no motion vectors" was reported as "this shot was too
  short".** FFmpeg exports motion vectors for H.264; HEVC, VP9 and AV1 give
  none, and an all-intra file has none to give. All three decoded fine, yielded
  nothing, and landed in `UNKNOWN` — whose explanation, in the CLI and in the
  Chinese UI (`幀數不足`), is a claim about the length of a shot. The truth is
  a claim about the container, and no amount of re-running changes it.

  Measured 2026-09-05 on real files: `pan_hevc`, `pan_vp9` and an all-intra
  H.264 all returned `frames=0`; a genuinely short H.264 shot returned
  `frames=5`. The two are now `unsupported` and `unknown`. The library today is
  118/118 H.264 so nothing was mislabelled yet — but `analyze <local path>`
  takes any file, and **an iPhone shoots HEVC by default**.

  A file that decodes *nothing* stays `unknown`: an unreadable stream is not
  evidence about the codec.

### Notes

- `MIN_FRAMES = 8` now says out loud that it has **no measurement behind it**,
  unlike `SPEED_FLOOR`, which sits on a measured hard zero. It asserts that
  eight frames are enough and seven are not, and nothing was run to separate
  them. Recorded rather than quietly kept: a threshold whose provenance is "it
  seemed right" is the kind that survives for years by never being questioned.
- `speed` is **not** `hypot(dx, dy)`, and the stored row now says so. They are
  different statistics on purpose — `dx`/`dy` are the medians of each component
  ("which way, typically"), `speed` is the median of the magnitudes ("how fast,
  typically"). A shot that drifts left as often as right has `dx ≈ 0` and a
  speed well above zero, and only the second answers "is this moving". A reader
  who assumed the identity could not reproduce the classification from the row.
- Found by an independent read-only audit of 1.4.0 (2026-09-05): R1, R10.

- **Four ways of declining to answer were read as the model saying "no".**
  `parse_gate_answer` prefix-matched `NO`, so `Not sure`, `None`, `Nope` and
  `NOTE: unclear` all came back False — and a False is stored as a confident
  `UNKNOWN` carrying the current fingerprint, which means the frame is never
  asked again. Under the gate's four-token budget "Not sure" is a reply the
  model actually gives. Now matched as a whole word, so those four fall
  through to the classifier while `no.`, `**No**` and `No person, but a dog`
  still answer. Anchored rather than searched, deliberately: *there is no
  ambiguity, yes* contains both words.

- **A run with `--no-gate` stamped the fingerprint of a procedure it never
  ran.** The hash covered both prompts, so a classification-only run claimed
  the gate had asked. v17 stopped two *prompts* sharing a column; this stops
  two *procedures* sharing one. `--no-gate` now has its own fingerprint and
  both count as current — the gated hash is **unchanged**, so the library's
  827 existing rows stay current instead of all going stale at once.

- **`db health` prescribed a command that cannot clear the row it appears on.**
  Interviews are skipped by default, so `shot-size <video>` on a `talking_head`
  clip returns having done nothing — and those are the clips most likely to be
  holding old labels. The fix line now names `--force`.

- **A label whose keyframe no longer exists was counted as a live reading.**
  `analyze --force-keyframes` moves the timestamps a label hangs off, and
  nothing ever asks about the old one again: `drop_superseded_label` matches
  `t_sec` exactly. The orphan then kept its clip on the re-run list forever,
  counted in `analysable`, and — because sizes match a shot by *span* — was
  what the inspector showed.

  🔴 **The obvious fix was wrong and the repo's own test caught it.** Deleting
  orphans contradicts a decision written down here: labels hang off timestamps
  rather than shot ids *precisely* so re-analysis cannot destroy them, and
  `test_a_refusal_leaves_labels_at_other_timestamps_alone` guards it. The first
  version of this fix deleted them and turned that test red. **Unreachable is
  not the same as wrong.** So the rows stay, and the three readers that were
  treating them as live were fixed instead: `stale_videos` no longer prescribes
  a re-run that cannot reach them, `analysable` counts only frames that exist,
  and the inspector prefers a live label over an orphan in the same span.
  `db health` reports them on their own row with **no fix offered**, because
  there is nothing to run.

### Changed

- Two docstrings claimed that "two passes with different models coexist rather
  than overwrite". They do not: `model` is not in the uniqueness key, so a
  second model under the same source replaces the first. That behaviour is
  correct — one asker changing its mind is not two claims — but it is the
  opposite of what was documented, and of what
  `test_two_models_coexist_instead_of_overwriting` was named after. The test
  compared two *sources*, never two models. Renamed, and the missing case
  added.
- `shot-size` reports an `orphaned` count. Counted, never deleted.

### Notes

- Verified against the live library before shipping: **827 of 827 labels hang
  off a keyframe that still exists**, so the orphan filter changes no current
  reading. The measurement matters more than the zero — a filter this quiet
  could have removed every number on the page and nothing would have said so.
- Found by an independent read-only audit of 1.4.0 (2026-09-05): R2, R3, R4,
  R5, R6.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **A model that answered nothing was deleting labels.** `shot-size` read every
  HTTP 200 from ollama as text. ollama returns 200 carrying its own `error`
  envelope, 200 with an empty string, and 200 with nothing but reasoning the
  token budget cut off before any verdict — none of which is an answer. The
  caller parsed the non-answer, failed, and reported `REFUSAL_UNPARSEABLE`:
  *the model answered and broke the vocabulary*. That is the one verdict
  allowed to retire a stored label, so `drop_superseded_label` ran and the row
  went. Measured 2026-09-05: **`qwen3-vl:8b`, which wrote 2593 of this
  library's vision descriptions, returns an empty string for both the gate and
  the classifier** — so re-running `shot-size` with it after any prompt change
  would have emptied the table rather than refilled it. Nothing was lost yet
  only because all 827 stored labels still carry the current fingerprint.

  A non-answer is now `REFUSAL_INCONCLUSIVE` and leaves stored rows alone,
  alongside `unreachable`. Two boundaries came with it, because the useful
  distinction is narrow and easy to overshoot in either direction:

  - A reply that stopped at the token budget is only inconclusive **if it also
    failed to parse**. `done_reason == "length"` on its own is not a failure —
    a four-token budget holds `MCU` — and rejecting every truncated reply
    would throw away good answers to avoid bad ones.
  - `EUC` at temperature 0 with `done_reason == "stop"` is still
    `REFUSAL_UNPARSEABLE`. The model answered; it will answer identically
    forever; the retired row still goes.

  The vision path had already learned this in 1.4.0 ("a 200 response with no
  `response` field … is not a generate response at all"). `label_shots` had
  not, which is the more useful half of the finding: **a lesson written into
  the changelog had not crossed to the module three files away.**

- **A keyframe whose file vanished mid-run took its label with it.** `missing`
  is checked before the model is asked, so reaching the file reader at all is a
  race — and that race landed in `refused`, which drops. Same asymmetry, third
  face: only a verdict may retire a row.

- **The gate and the classifier stored side by side, so a re-run never
  converged.** They are two questions in one asking, but they wrote under
  different `source` values — and `source` is part of the unique key, so
  neither replaced the other. A frame answered by the gate on one run and the
  classifier on the next ended up holding both rows. Three consequences, each
  reproduced:

  - the clip never left `stale_videos`, because one of its two rows always
    carried the retired prompt. **This is precisely what #105 ("make a re-run
    converge") claimed to fix**; it converges within a source and never
    noticed the case across two.
  - `analysable` counted one frame as two — and the caller prints that number
    as `%d/%d frame(s)`, so a library with a gate pass reported a denominator
    twice its own size.
  - the inspector showed whichever source sorted first, and `gate` sorts
    before `vlm`: a stale UNKNOWN covered a fresh CU.

  A model row now replaces the other model source at the same frame: one
  frame, one model verdict. `supplied` is deliberately **not** part of that —
  a person's correction and a model's guess are different kinds of claim and
  still sit side by side. Only the two halves of one asking collapse into each
  other.

- **A hand-supplied size outranked the model by alphabetical accident.** The
  rule was in the code (`or row["source"] == "supplied"`) and the test passed
  without it: `'supplied'` sorts before `'vlm'`, so it landed first and the
  model row never overwrote it either way. `'gate'` does not sort before
  `'supplied'` — so the first time a gated UNKNOWN and a human correction
  shared a frame, the UNKNOWN would have won. Precedence is now stated rather
  than read off the sort order, and the test that pins it uses a `gate` row,
  which is the only arrangement that asks the question.

- **A zoom was reported as a locked-off camera, with high confidence.**
  `motion` read `motion_x`/`motion_y` and took their median, which measures
  *translation* and nothing else. The vector field of a push-in is radial and
  the field of a rotation is tangential, and **both have a median of exactly
  (0, 0)** — so a shot that ended 45% tighter came back as `speed 0.00,
  agreement 0.93` and was classified `static`. Not `unknown`: the wrong class,
  carrying a confidence number. Punch-in and Ken Burns are among the most
  common moves in short-form video, so `STATIC 1851/3468 (53%)` could not be
  read at all — nobody knew how much of it was zoom.

  The module's own docstring said it was using "positions *and* motions, which
  is what makes the two cases separable". It had never read a position.

  Each frame is now fitted with a similarity transform — translation, scale,
  rotation — over the block displacements. Measured on synthetic clips, through
  the shipped code path and a storage round-trip:

  | clip | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | 45% push-in | `static` | `camera_moves`, zoom +7.7% |
  | 200% push-in | `still_subject_moves` | `camera_moves`, zoom +72.6% |
  | 51.6° rotation | `static` | `camera_moves`, rotation +14.2° |
  | 80 px/s pan | `camera_moves` | `camera_moves`, zoom **+0.0%** |
  | locked off | `static` | `static` |
  | subject over 70% of frame | `static` | `static` |

  Two decisions inside the fit, each taken against a measurement rather than a
  preference:

  - **Outliers are dropped and the fit repeated.** On a pan the leading edge
    of the frame has no reference content, and one least squares reads those
    junk vectors as scale: a pure pan fitted **-11.8% zoom and +9.6°**, which
    is *larger* than a real 45% push-in measures. Any threshold above that
    noise would have been above the signal too.
  - **The inlier set is seeded from the median, then grown by the fit's own
    tolerance.** Seeding, because least squares has no majority rule — thirty
    still blocks and twenty moving 6 px, which is the definition of
    `still_subject_moves`, fitted a translation of **2.50** and would have been
    reported as a camera move. Growing, because a zoom's blocks disagree with
    the median *by construction*, so seeding alone would discard the signal
    being looked for.

  ⚠️ **The magnitudes are a floor, not a reading.** A 45% push-in measures
  +7.7% and a 200% one +72.6%: the encoder quantises a sub-pixel displacement
  to a zero vector, and seeding costs more of it. The number answers "did the
  frame transform beyond translation, and roughly how much", not "by exactly
  how much". Seeding was chosen knowing it costs magnitude, because a fit that
  a moving subject can pull is the worse failure — it turns a still camera into
  a camera move, which is a claim about the filmmaker.

### Changed

- Schema **v19**: `shot_motion` gains `zoom` and `rotation`. Rows written
  before it get NULL, not 0.0 — a zero would claim the shot was checked for
  zoom and found to have none, which is a different statement from not having
  looked. `dx`/`dy` keep the codec's direction, unchanged, so v18 and v19 rows
  stay comparable; only the new columns use the reader's convention, where a
  positive `zoom` means the frame got tighter.

- `frame_motion()` yields six values per frame instead of four, and
  `classify()` takes the shot's total zoom and rotation as optional arguments.
  `agreement` now means "the share of blocks the fit explains" rather than "the
  share matching one translation" — which is why a fast push-in stops reading
  as handheld.

- `dx`/`dy` arrive from a least squares solve rather than a median, so they
  are no longer bit-exact: 4.0 comes back as 3.999999999999997.

### Notes

- `ZOOM_FLOOR` (3%) and `ROTATION_FLOOR` (3°) are totals **across the shot**,
  not per frame — half a second at the same rate changes no framing a viewer
  would call a move. Both are set from four synthetic clips, two true and two
  false: a thinner base than `SPEED_FLOOR`, which sits on a measured hard zero,
  and stated so the next person can widen them rather than trust them.

- `shot-size` reports a `collapsed` count, non-zero only on the first run
  after this change: a silent DELETE is indistinguishable from data that was
  never there. One `shot-size <video>` run cleans that clip's duplicates,
  since every frame it visits is rewritten.

- `shot-size` gained an `inconclusive` count in its tally, reported separately
  from `refused` and `unreachable` for the reason those two were split in the
  first place: the operator needs to know **which run is worth repeating**, and
  the three causes have three different answers.

- Every one of these was found by a single independent read-only audit of 1.4.0 on 2026-09-05 (findings B1, B2, B3 and mutations
  M21, M42). Each fix ships with the mutation that proves its guard has teeth: reverting it turns the new tests red, and before the
  fixes the same mutations turned nothing red at all.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-09-04


### Added in 1.4.0, recorded 2026-09-05

Six merged changes reached 1.4.0 with no entry. Found by an independent audit
(R9) and confirmed against `git log --first-parent v1.3.1..v1.4.0`, 60 merges.
Written now rather than left out: a changelog with holes is worse than a short
one, because a reader cannot tell which it is.

- **`mark` — moments on a clip's timeline, shown alongside it in the
  inspector** (#70). Added `clip_marks`, **schema v13**. The one whose absence
  mattered most: it introduced a table, and a schema step with no changelog
  entry is a step nobody knows to look for.
- **A clip is identified by its URL, not by matching strings** (#71).
- **Downloads pick a codec Apple devices can play** (#78, #79). Excluding AV1
  was not enough — the whole library was unplayable on an iPad. Instagram and
  TikTok had **no codec condition at all**, and 88 of 103 bad files came from
  there.
- **A transcript outlives its media** (#80), so deleting a video no longer
  silently takes the text with it.
- **A near-miss BPM is reported instead of vanishing** (#84). The two states it
  could not tell apart were "flattened" and "no rhythm at all" — which are
  opposite readings of the same clip.
- **`stats` reports evidence coverage** (#85, #87), so a newly landed
  extraction layer is measured in the same round it ships: shots coverage was
  3 of 116 when it was first looked at.

### Fixed

- **A video that never processed entered the corpus as a craft score of 0.0, and
  every aggregate averaged it in.** A 4h11m livestream (`RwyLahUuGcc`) held
  0.0 on all four dimensions with `status='analyzed'`. It was not a weak video:
  keyframe extraction had produced **zero** frames, so the merge stage had no
  visual layer, returned unparseable output, and stored an analysis whose entire
  body was `{"summary": "{\n", "topics": [], "error": "failed to parse JSON"}`.
  The scorer then ran on that carcass — its own reasoning field reads
  "impossible to score the video accurately" — and the pipeline wrote that
  refusal down as 0.0. Three stages each manufactured a plausible artifact from
  nothing, and a NULL would have been visibly missing where a 0.0 silently
  averages. One fake row in 111 was holding down the floor of every dimension in
  `stats`: min overall read 0.0, when the corpus floor is really 3.05.
  The pipeline now checks, at the single point where keyframe extraction has
  definitively been attempted, for `keyframes == 0` alongside a non-empty
  transcript — speech proves the media decoded, so zero frames is a
  contradiction rather than a hard-to-sample clip. Such a video is marked
  `status='invalid'` with the measurements as its reason, and the run stops
  before vision, merge and score can invent anything. `stats` and `patterns`
  exclude invalid rows and report the excluded count rather than quietly
  shrinking. `scorer.score_video` refuses a video already marked invalid, so the
  number cannot come back by a second route. The all-zero score is deliberately
  *not* part of the test: a genuinely terrible video still has frames, and
  marking real work invalid because the score looked bad would be worse than the
  defect. `reel-scout db check-invalid [--apply]` audits an existing library;
  it reports by default, marks only when asked, and never deletes.
- **`stats` averaged two rulers into one number.** A craft score is only
  meaningful against the model that produced it — the same clip scores 7.43
  under `qwen3-vl:8b` and 5.5 under `qwen2.5vl:7b` — and `ingest` stamps every
  agent-supplied row `agent:<model>` precisely so the origin survives. `stats`
  then ignored that column entirely: a library holding agent-scored and
  locally-scored videos reported a single blended mean, and the blend can land
  in a gap where no video sits. Six videos scoring 8.5/8.0/8.3 (agent) and
  5.0/5.5/5.2 (local) reported `overall 6.8 / 5.0-8.5 (n=6)` — more than a full
  point away from every video in the corpus, with nothing on screen to say two
  scales were in play. Score aggregates are now grouped by `model_used`
  (`score_aggregates_by_model`, `score_sources`), and the pooled block is kept
  but labelled as pooled whenever `mixed_score_sources` is true, in the table,
  in `--json`, and in `--csv`. Grouping is on the exact model string, the finest
  grain that is correct — two local VLMs are no more comparable to each other
  than an agent is to either. Per-video reads and the existing `score,*` CSV
  rows are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **`compare` put two scores side by side without saying which ruler each came
  from.** Same defect as above, one surface over: the comparison table is the
  single place a reader is most likely to turn two numbers into "A beats B",
  and two clips scored by different models cannot support that reading at all.
  The table now carries a `Score source` row, directly above the numbers it
  qualifies — the same placement and the same reasoning as the `Transcript` row
  added earlier. A score written before provenance existed reads as an em dash,
  which is "scored, origin unrecorded" and deliberately not the same as having
  no score.
- **A stored media path stopped meaning anything once you changed directory.**
  `DATA_DIR` defaults to `./data` — relative to whatever cwd the process started
  in — so rows written from the repo root recorded `./data/videos/x.mp4` while
  rows written anywhere else recorded an absolute path. A live database holds
  both. `analyze` checked the stored path with a bare `os.path.exists()`, so run
  from any other directory it concluded the file was missing and downloaded it
  again; `resolve_video_file` looked cwd-relative first and then fell back to
  `VIDEOS_DIR`, which is itself cwd-relative, so both of its candidates missed
  too. Resolution is now anchored to the data root and tries every shape a
  stored path can have — portable, legacy, cwd, and basename-under-`VIDEOS_DIR`
  for files that moved between data directories. `reel-scout db normalize-paths
  [--dry-run]` rewrites existing rows to the portable form; rows whose path
  cannot be resolved are reported and deliberately left alone, because
  rewriting a path you cannot verify turns a recoverable row into a confidently
  wrong one.
- **An LLM call that timed out took the clip down with it, and the timeout was
  unreachable from outside the source.** The 600s limit was a hardcoded constant
  with no retry, so a transient condition produced a permanent loss: on
  2026-08-11 a 96-clip re-merge dropped 3 clips to Ollama contention, and all
  three re-ran fine at 84/125/101s once the machine was idle. Contention is an
  external condition and a fixed constant is an internal choice; welding them
  together meant the only way to survive a busy machine was to edit the code.
  `LLM_TIMEOUT`, `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` and `LLM_RETRY_BACKOFF` are now environment
  variables and appear in `config show`. Retries are for timeouts **only** — a
  malformed request or a missing model fails identically on attempt three, so
  retrying those would just delay the same error by timeout × retries.
- **A 403 during the download killed the ingest even though the format chain had
  three more selectors left.** The `/` chain in `-f` degrades while *choosing* a
  format; once a format is chosen and the transfer itself dies, yt-dlp does not
  walk to the next selector — it fails, and the clip never enters the library.
  Seen in the wild on E8Bx9OlpmdM, where the separate video stream 403'd while
  the same video downloaded fine as progressive `18`. The fallback therefore has
  to live at the download layer, not in the selector string: if the quality-first
  attempt produces no file, a progressive format is tried before the failure is
  raised. Progressive formats come from a different URL than the split streams,
  which is exactly why they survive when the split ones do not. Quality-first
  stays first; this is the "something beats nothing" floor, the same trade the
  existing chain already makes for AV1.
- **Opening a database that did not exist created an empty one and said nothing.**
  `DB_PATH` is cwd-relative, so running from the wrong directory produced a fresh
  empty database that then reported zero pending work — indistinguishable from a
  library that is fully up to date. Three separate incidents traced back to this.
  `init_db` now prints a one-line notice with the **absolute** path when it
  creates the file, which is the piece that makes the mistake visible: the path
  is either the one you expected or obviously not. Creating on demand is kept
  deliberately — raising instead was checked and rejected, because 40+ call sites
  and first-run setup all depend on it, so the fix is to remove the silence, not
  the behaviour.
- **A Chinese transcript could change script partway through a single file, and
  searching it found only the first half.** One 28,331-character transcript in
  the reference library is traditional up to 83% and simplified from there, with
  no interleaving and no error: searching it for `這` returns the first 83% and
  reports nothing wrong. `save_transcript` now scans for script mixing and warns
  with the position of the flip. It **reports and does not convert** — converting
  requires first deciding which script the library standardises on, and it would
  add a dependency the core install deliberately does not have. The detector's
  character sets exclude 後/后 and 麼/么, whose "simplified" forms are also real
  traditional characters (皇后, 幺么); a detector that fires on clean text teaches
  people to ignore it. Validated against the library: 18/18 mixed files found,
  zero false positives.
- **A warning that could not be printed took the transcript down with it.** The
  mixed-script notice above carries an emoji and an em dash, and it printed
  *before* the `INSERT`. `cli.py` reconfigures both streams to UTF-8, but it is
  the **CLI** entry point — `mcp/server.py` never runs it, and the MCP server is
  exactly how the Windows students reach this package, on the cp950/cp1252/cp437
  consoles this repo has already been bitten by once. On those, the print raised
  `UnicodeEncodeError` and the transcript was never stored: a detector that
  deleted the data it was watching. Two independent fixes, because one of them
  being enough is not a reason to leave the other broken. `utils.stderr.warn`
  degrades characters the console cannot encode and never raises at its caller —
  whether the operator sees a line is not worth the caller's work. And the scan
  now runs before the write while the report happens after it, so even a failure
  `warn` deliberately does not absorb costs nothing but the message.
- **The download retry could resume a different format's partial file.** Both
  attempts write to the same `yt_<id>.mp4.part` and yt-dlp resumes partials by
  default, so a first selector that picked a progressive format and died
  mid-transfer left bytes that the second attempt would extend with a Range
  request against a *different* stream. Nothing validates that the two halves
  came from the same video, and the result is a corrupt file that exists — which
  the caller's `os.path.exists` check reads as success, the exact failure this
  release is about. The fallback now passes `--no-continue`.
- **The fallback quietly handed back a lower-quality clip.** It usually lands on
  format 18 (360p). Silently substituting it is its own small version of
  reporting success for the wrong result, so it now says on stderr that the
  preferred formats produced nothing and that quality will be lower.
- **A 200 response with no `response` field was returned as an empty string.** An
  empty `response` is legitimate — the model produced nothing. A *missing* one
  means the reply is not a generate response at all: an error envelope, a proxy
  in front of Ollama, a schema that moved. Both arrived at the merger as an empty
  result that read as a successful call. The missing case now says so. It is not
  raised, because a compatible backend may legitimately differ and a hard error
  would break a setup that works today.
- **ffmpeg and whisper.cpp still reported the wrong end of stderr.** `crawl/ytdlp.py`
  fixed this for yt-dlp, but the audio-extraction and whisper.cpp paths kept a
  blind `stderr[:300]` / `[:500]`. Both print banners and progress first and the
  cause last, so the head shown was reliably the part carrying no information —
  an ffmpeg permission error sat past the cut behind five lines of build
  configuration. Both now report error-looking lines, falling back to the tail.
- **A batch where every item failed exited 0.** Both `batch` and `analyze`
  printed an explanation and returned `None`, so the dispatcher's
  `if code: raise SystemExit(code)` never fired and a wrapper reading `$?` was
  told the work was done. `analyze` also printed `Batch <id> completed.` on a run
  where the only item had errored on the line above — "completed" on its own
  reads as "worked", and it now says `completed with N/M failed.`, the same
  distinction the MCP surface draws with `completed_with_failures`. A Ctrl-C is
  deliberately still not counted: it leaves work undone too, but the operator
  pressed it and the screen says so.
- **One message stood in for four different reasons the vision fallback did not
  run.** Whatever blocked it, the log said `fallback '<model>' unavailable`. On a
  run whose backend was not ollama the first condition already settled it and the
  availability probe was never called — so the line named a missing model that
  was installed and answering, and acting on it means installing what is already
  there. Each reason now says its own name, and the "not installed" one says
  which host it looked at so the claim can be checked. The probe stays last,
  because it is a network call and a cheaper reason usually settles the question.
- **The console-encoding fix only ever ran on the CLI entry point.** `main()` in
  `cli.py` called it; the MCP server did not, so a description carrying a
  character the console could not encode took the server down instead of the
  frame. It now runs on both, and the warning path degrades unencodable
  characters rather than raising inside the warning itself.
- **A leftover file at the destination let a download report success without
  transferring a byte.** yt-dlp exits 0 when the target already exists, so a
  truncated or unusable file from an earlier attempt was read as a completed
  download. Unusable outputs are now renamed aside (`.unusable`, never deleted,
  `.vtt` siblings moved with them) and success is judged on both the return code
  and the file actually being there; the format fallback passes `--no-continue`
  so it cannot resume a different format's partial file.
- **Keyframes collapsed onto the opening seconds of a clip** (`scene` strategy,
  the default). The cause was in the ffmpeg pass that *detects* scenes, not the
  one that cuts them: `-frames:v N` makes ffmpeg exit after N outputs, so
  detection stopped early and everything after that point was invisible to the
  sampler. Measured before the change, 27 clips had a single unsampled gap larger
  than half their length; measured after, across a library that had grown to 110,
  one — and that one is a 22-second clip whose first 13 seconds are a single
  unchanging shot, so there is nothing there to sample. Mean largest gap went
  from 35.6% of clip length to 17.3%. Detection now runs unbounded and writes no
  images at all (`-f null -`); the second pass seeks to each selected timestamp.
  Selection
  spreads across the time axis rather than the ordinal one, so a clip whose cuts
  cluster at the front no longer spends its whole budget there. The `motion`
  strategy carried the same defect until the entry below.
- **`motion` keyframes collapsed onto the opening quarter-second, and the
  timestamps written beside them were invented.** Two defects, compounding.
  `-frames:v max_frames` capped the emitting pass, and mpdecimate emits across
  the whole file — measured, 405 of a 13.7-second reel's ~411 frames survive it
  — so the cap always fired inside the first second and the rest of the clip was
  never decoded. Underneath that, `setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB` sat *before*
  `showinfo`, so the `pts_time` being parsed was the surviving frame's ordinal
  over the frame rate rather than its position in the video: on a clip built as
  5s frozen plus 5s moving, the old chain reported 0.00–0.27s for frames that
  actually came from 0.00s and 5.00–5.20s. Every motion keyframe ever written
  therefore carried a timestamp that was fiction, and anything aligned to one —
  OCR spans, marks, the inspector timeline — inherited it. Same two-pass
  restructure as `scene`: detection runs unbounded, writes no images (`-f null
  -`) and no longer rewrites the clock, then `select_spread` picks across the
  time axis and a second pass seeks to each chosen timestamp. Measured on four
  library clips at a budget of 8, the sampled span went from 0.6–2.4% of clip
  length to 99.3–99.8%. The unbounded pass costs real time — a 13.7s reel went
  from 0.12s to 2.28s, a 37.5s reel from 0.19s to 4.48s, and a 22-minute clip
  takes 37.5s — so detection now shares `scene`'s duration-scaled timeout
  (renamed `detect_timeout`), and an overrun falls through to interval sampling
  instead of ending the run with nothing.
- **Three ffmpeg/ffprobe calls in the keyframe module read their output with the
  console codepage.** `text=True` without `encoding` decodes with the locale's
  encoding, and ffmpeg echoes the input path and its metadata into the same
  stderr the timestamp parser reads — so a CJK filename under a cp950 or C
  console killed the extraction with a `UnicodeDecodeError` that named nothing
  relevant. All three now decode UTF-8 explicitly and leniently: what is parsed
  out of that stream is ASCII digits, so a replacement character in a banner
  line is cosmetic, whereas a strict decode would turn it into a crash.
- **A model that reasons before answering spent the entire token budget
  reasoning.** At the old ceiling the reply came back `done_reason: "length"`
  with zero characters, which downstream is indistinguishable from a frame with
  nothing to say. Reasoning length varies far more than answer length — usually
  around 440 tokens, with a tail well past 1200 — so raising the default further
  is racing a distribution with no upper bound. A frame that hit the ceiling now
  gets one retry at a larger budget; a frame that finished on its own does not,
  because retrying it returns the same thing more slowly. `think: false` was
  measured and does not work here (ollama 0.30.7 + qwen3-vl:8b keeps reasoning
  and leaks a raw `<think>` tag). The warning that fires when even the retry came
  back empty says how far it already got, so nobody raises a number twice.
- **One wedged step could block a batch for as long as the machine stayed up.**
  `batch.py` ran its child steps with no timeout at all, so a stuck ffmpeg or a
  model that never answered held every remaining clip behind it — and the run
  looked busy the whole time, which is the worst shape a stall can take. Each
  step now has its own deadline and the batch has one overall: `analyze` at
  1800s (just under the 1815s worst case a single merge can spend burning its
  full retry budget — a call that reaches that number *is* the pathology),
  `export` at 300s, and `score` derived from `LLM_TIMEOUT` rather than fixed,
  because a subprocess kill that pre-empts the backend's own error path throws
  away the diagnosis the retry existed to produce.
- **A run stopped by the clock reported the same thing as a run that finished.**
  `incomplete` is now its own state, separate from `completed` (the list was not
  finished), `failed` (the worker did its job) and `completed_with_failures`
  (nothing failed). Folding it into any of those asks the reader either to
  re-run URLs that are fine or to assume URLs are fine when nobody looked at
  them; the payload now names which were never attempted.
- **The timeout could kill the process that was enforcing it.** Steps run in
  their own process group so a wedged grandchild dies with its parent, but a
  naive `killpg` on a process that was never detached reaches the whole tree
  including the runner. The kill now resolves which group it may signal and
  refuses to touch its own. (This was found by mutation testing, and the
  mutation that found it took down the tool chain that was running it — the
  file stayed mutated, so every later run silently tested code nobody wrote.
  The runner now restores on startup as well as in `finally`.)

### Notes

- **Annotations live in their own tables** (`video_annotations`,
  `annotation_groups`; schema v11), never as columns on `videos`. Everything else
  in the database is derived from the source clip and is safe to regenerate;
  these rows are the operator's judgement. Re-crawling, re-analyzing and
  re-scoring rewrite the pipeline's output and cannot touch a note — there is a
  test that holds that line. Deleting a group clears the filing and keeps every
  note and star.
- **The take-home export ships no annotations.** They are working state, not
  something a reader should receive; the exported single-file HTML has no server
  to write to and stays entirely read-only, and its strapline still says so. The
  served list gets its own strapline, because claiming "read-only" on a page that
  writes would be a lie.
- **The HTTP write surface is narrow on purpose**: `POST` is accepted only on the
  annotation endpoints, bodies over 64 KB are refused before being read, and
  everything the pipeline produced remains read-only over HTTP.
### Added

- **Shot sizes, and a column that remembers which prompt produced them**
  (`shot-size`, schema v15/v17). Seven codes sourced from
  `prompts/storyboard-visualize.md`, one label per shot's representative frame.
  The prompt's fingerprint is stored beside each label because a prompt change
  moved the answer ten-to-one on the same images: listing the codes with their
  English names returned `ECU` ten times where defining each code by
  subject-to-frame ratio returned it once. `db health` reports labels made by a
  superseded prompt and names the command that refreshes them.
- **A gate that asks whether the question applies before asking it.** A binary
  "is this a single photographic shot with a person as its subject" pass runs
  first; frames it rejects are stored as `UNKNOWN` rather than given a code.
  Measured on 12 hand-judged frames: 2/12 correct without the gate, 10/12 with
  it. It rejects roughly 70% of this corpus, and it adds ~13% to the pass rather
  than doubling it, because everything rejected skips the classifier.
  `--no-gate` restores the old behaviour.
- **`analysable`, reported next to the codes and never without them.** Of 94
  labelled clips, 40 have no frame the vocabulary applies to — they are screen
  recordings, title cards and composite layouts. Showing codes alone would
  present those forty as confidently as the two that scored 100%.
- **Camera movement per shot, read from the codec's own motion vectors**
  (`motion`, schema v18, new `[motion]` extra). Four states from two numbers —
  median block motion and the share of blocks that agree with it: the camera is
  locked off, the camera holds while something inside the frame moves, the
  camera moves coherently, or the motion is incoherent (handheld, compositing).
  Across 3,468 shots: 53% static, 8% unsteady, 7% still-with-subject-motion,
  2.5% coherent camera moves, the rest too short to say.
  Direction is stored but deliberately not named: across 585 hand-scanned shots
  only seven were coherent moves, and seven is not enough to earn a vocabulary.
- **A Chinese mirror for free text** (`translate`, schema v16), and the
  inspector renders both languages side by side. Translations record the hash of
  the source they were made from, so an edited source shows as stale rather than
  silently keeping an old translation.
- **`db health`** — one command that says what is measurable, what is missing,
  and which command closes each gap. Counts, never percentages; "cannot" is
  separated from "not yet"; `--strict` fails only on gaps something on this
  machine can actually close.
- **`db backfill-shots`** for clips analysed before the `shots` table existed,
  and **`export --format storyboard`** with `storyboard-diff` for the return
  trip.
- **A shot-grammar block in the web inspector** — per-shot size and movement
  with the numbers the movement class came from, plus the analysable ratio.

- **Keyframe extraction is a run with an identity, so re-sampling is possible
  without destroying the evidence it replaces.** Frames used to be tied to the
  clip alone, which made "extract again with different settings" either
  impossible or a deletion. A run (`keyframe_runs`, schema v12) owns its frames
  and its descriptions; a new run supersedes the previous one instead of
  overwriting it, everything downstream reads the current run, and the old frames
  and their descriptions stay on disk to compare against. `--force-keyframes`
  asks for a new run explicitly. Frames are committed only after they have landed,
  so an interrupted extraction cannot leave a run pointing at files that are not
  there.
- **`retry_call`** — the retry helper had a decorator with no call sites and no
  way to say *which* failures are worth retrying. It now takes a `should_retry`
  predicate and an `on_retry` hook, and the decorator delegates to it. (It also
  raised `None` when configured with zero attempts.)
- **Near-duplicate keyframes are dropped instead of described.** `frame_cap`
  decides how many frames a clip may spend; this decides how many it actually
  needs. They fix different defects — the cap fixed "long clips sampled too
  sparsely", this fixes "consecutive samples look identical and each one still
  costs a local VLM call".

  **Nothing is topped up.** A version that backfilled to the cap would cost
  exactly what it cost before, and would also hide whether the pass works at
  all, because the count would always equal the cap. Coming in under budget is
  the point.

  Two guards stop this re-creating the sparse-timeline defect the cap exists to
  fix. A frame is only ever dropped while the previous **kept** frame is within
  `KEYFRAME_DEDUPE_MAX_GAP_SEC` (120s) — two identical-looking frames seventeen
  minutes apart are information ("nothing changed for seventeen minutes"), two
  seconds apart is noise. And `KEYFRAME_DEDUPE_MIN` (4) floors the count so a
  static short clip cannot collapse to a single frame. First and last are never
  dropped, and a frame ffmpeg cannot read is never dropped either.

  The hash is a 64-bit dHash computed **through ffmpeg**, not Pillow: ffmpeg is
  already a hard requirement, Pillow is only in the `ocr` extra, and a dedupe
  pass is not worth promoting an optional dependency to a core one. One extra
  ffmpeg call per frame, milliseconds each, against the seconds a VLM call
  costs — removing one frame pays for the whole pass.

  **Measured on the real 100-video library: 1,202 → 1,148 frames, 54 VLM calls
  avoided (4.5%), 22 videos affected.** That is deliberately modest. The default
  distance threshold (4 of 64 bits) only removes frames a person would call the
  same frame, and this library is mostly fast-cut short-form, where consecutive
  keyframes genuinely differ. The one long clip in the set (52 min) dropped 6 of
  40. Expect the saving to grow with long static footage — lectures, interviews,
  streams — which is exactly where a flat cap wastes the most.

  Off with `KEYFRAME_DEDUPE=0`; `KEYFRAME_DEDUPE_DISTANCE` loosens or tightens
  it. `reel-scout config` prints all four values.

- **Long clips get a sampling rate, not the same twelve frames a reel gets.** The
  keyframe cap was one flat number, so a 9-second reel and an 82-minute interview
  drew the same budget — the reel sampled about once a second, the interview once
  every seven minutes. Downstream that produced a `timeline` whose single segment
  covered 96% of the clip: technically produced, practically useless. The cap now
  stays flat up to `KEYFRAME_LONG_SEC` (180s — **short-form behaviour is unchanged,
  bit for bit**) and above it earns `KEYFRAME_PER_MIN` frames a minute up to
  `KEYFRAME_MAX_LONG` (40). The ceiling is the point: 82 minutes asks for 164
  frames at 2/min and is told 40. Each frame is still one local VLM call, so the
  cost red line moved deliberately, not accidentally.
- **Delete a group from the page.** A picker plus a button in the toolbar, rather
  than an X inside each row's dropdown — a group is a library-wide object, and its
  destructor does not belong inside a per-video control. Each option carries its
  row count as the warning, and deleting still keeps every note and star.

- **Your own layer on the library: a note, a group, a star.** The served list
  (`reel-scout view`) is now a table, because it carries per-row controls a list
  of links had nowhere to put: a **star** to mark what is worth coming back to,
  a **group** dropdown you define yourself (add / rename / delete), and a free-text
  **note** for what a clip is *for*. The star in the table header is the filter —
  press it to show only what you marked. Notes save as you type; the group and the
  star save on the spot.

  The pipeline decodes what a video *is*; none of it knows what you intend to do
  with it, and that intent is the part worth typing by hand.

  Same three fields from the CLI (`reel-scout note <ref> --text … --group … --star`,
  `reel-scout group list|add|rename|rm`) and over MCP (`annotate`,
  `list_annotations`), all going through one operations module so the rules —
  group names unique case-insensitively, notes rejected rather than truncated —
  are enforced once instead of three times, slightly differently.

### Changed

- **`classify_with_ollama` returns `(code, refusal)` instead of bare `None`.**
  One value used to cover four causes — an unreadable image, ollama being
  unreachable, malformed JSON, and a model answering outside the vocabulary —
  and the caller counted all four as "refused". Only the last is deterministic;
  an outage is emphatically worth retrying. The split is what makes it safe to
  act on a refusal at all.
- **Schema v13 → v18**, applied by the existing migration ladder: `shots` (v14),
  `shot_labels` (v15), `translations` (v16), `shot_labels.prompt_hash` (v17),
  `shot_motion` (v18). Every one is additive.

  ⚠️ **v13 is where `master` was, not where a PyPI user is.** The previous
  release on PyPI, 1.3.1, shipped `SCHEMA_VERSION = 10`, so an upgrade from
  the published version runs **v10 → v18**. Both paths were tested on real
  backups, but the range in this line describes the repo's history rather
  than anyone's upgrade.

### Known limits

- 🔴 **Shot sizes are a signal, not ground truth, and the ceiling is not the
  model.** Same 12 frames, same prompt: `qwen2.5vl:7b` 2/12, `gemma3:27b` 1/12,
  GPT-5.5 2/12 — three tiers, the same score, wrong on the same frames. A third
  of this corpus has no person in it at all, and the seven codes are defined by
  where a human body is cut, so those frames have no correct answer to pick.
  Spelling the exceptions out inside the seven-way prompt made it *worse*
  (2/12 → 0/12) and three times slower; the same rules as a binary question
  score 10/12. The published literature puts subject-centric models at ~88% on
  curated film material and motion-vector methods at ~52%, which is why movement
  reads from motion vectors and scale does not.
- ⚠️ Movement tolerates the codec's frame-type rhythm rather than correcting for
  it: adjacent frames of one shot measured 2% and 55% moving blocks, and a
  median over a strictly alternating series is its mean. The thresholds were set
  on data carrying the same rhythm.

- **`show_video` no longer hands an agent a whole transcript timeline it did not
  ask for.** Measured across the 101-video library with the same serializer both
  sides, one call used to return up to **288,359 tokens** — a four-hour clip whose
  5,808 timed segments dwarfed everything else in the payload. Three things
  changed, and each one keeps what it trims reachable rather than dropping it:
  - **Timed `segments` are opt-in.** They are gone from the default response;
    `has_segments` and `segment_count` take their place, so an agent still knows
    they exist and can pass `include_segments: true` when it actually needs to cut
    on a timecode. The flat `text_full` still comes free. When segments *are*
    returned, `confidence` is rounded to 3 dp — whisper emits the full float repr
    (`-0.1858760386370541`), which is roughly twenty characters of noise per
    segment for a number nobody reads past the second decimal.
  - **`analysis.full` is de-duplicated against its own projections.** It used to
    ship whole while `summary` / `topics` / `hooks` / `style` /
    `engagement_signals` sat beside it as separate keys — the same content twice.
    Only those five keys are stripped: `timeline`, `content_type`,
    `content_structure` and `measured` live nowhere else and still ship. (`hook`
    was verified byte-equal to `hooks_json` on all 99 analysed rows before it went
    on the strip list; it is not there because the name looked similar.)
  - **`keyframes` is capped at 12 by default**, with `keyframes_total` and
    `keyframes_truncated` reporting what happened and `max_keyframes: 0` lifting
    the cap entirely.

  Result on the same library: total **1,098,903 → 428,460** tokens, p90
  **8,467 → 4,459**, worst case **288,359 → 50,596**.

  ⚠️ **This changes a default over MCP.** Anything that read
  `show_video(...)["transcript"]["segments"]` without passing `include_segments`
  will now find the key absent — check `has_segments` and ask for them.


## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **Interface speaks Traditional Chinese now — a toggle, not a rebuild.** The
  inspector *and* the read-only viewer (library list + take-home bundle) carry
  both `en` and `zh-Hant` dictionaries in the page, so `EN / 中文` is an instant
  client swap with nothing to fetch — a bundle stays bilingual offline. It follows
  the browser's language on first load and remembers the choice. The line held
  everywhere: only interface chrome carries a `data-i18n` key; the model's own
  output — reasoning, transcript, decoded-structure *values* like `educational`,
  OCR text — is never touched, because translating it would mean silently
  re-running the model. One `reel_scout/i18n.py` is the single source both pages
  read, so they cannot drift.
- **Re-weight the craft score without re-running anything.** The inspector's score
  block hides a collapsed panel of weight sliders: drag them and `overall`
  recomputes live against the four stored dimensions, showing your result beside
  the stored default. The dimensions themselves never move — they come from the
  model, and the rubric behind them is prose, not a tunable threshold — so the
  honest thing to expose is the *blend*, and the panel says so. Weights renormalize
  to sum to 100 % so the number can't leave the 0–10 axis. The weights used to live
  in three hand-kept copies; they now collapse to one `config.SCORE_WEIGHTS` that
  both the scorer prompt and the recompute read.
- **MCP server — an agent can drive reel-scout without a shell.** The tools cover
  the read side (`list_videos`, `show_video`, `get_transcript`, and a `keyframes`
  tool so an agent with no filesystem can still see the frames) and the write side
  (`ingest` vision/score/analysis, a background `batch`, and `inspect`). `reel-scout
  mcp install` / `mcp path` register the server in the client's JSON without
  hand-editing it.
- **`ingest analysis` — the third thing only a model can give you.** `merge_analysis`
  needs a reachable LLM; without one it fails with a connection error and the
  `analyses` row is never written, so the 4-beat timeline, hook type and CTA type —
  most of the point — are silently absent. An agent can now supply that structure in
  the merge prompt's own shape. The low-cardinality fields are validated as enums,
  because they become columns `stats` and `patterns` group on and an invented value
  adds a one-member category to every aggregate. Provenance rides in `full_json`
  as `_source`.
- **The exported page now shows what was seen in each frame.** The filmstrip carries
  each keyframe's description (hover, plus a caption that tracks playback). A bundle
  that showed thumbnails and a score with no observations behind it asked the reader
  to take the number on faith — and at L1 those descriptions *are* the analysis.
- **`batch` — a doc full of links, one bundle each.** Point it at a Google
  Doc/Sheet (or a file, or stdin) and every IG/TikTok/Shorts link in it gets
  analyzed and exported. `/edit` URLs are rewritten to Google's export endpoints,
  so "anyone with the link" sharing is enough — no API key, no OAuth, no publish
  step. `--dry-run` shows what was parsed before anything runs. It **picks nothing
  for you**: a reachable VLM makes `--mode full` unambiguous, but without one it
  stops and presents `agent` / `transcript` / `full` rather than quietly shipping
  transcript-only bundles with the craft score missing. In `agent` mode it ends by
  listing the videos still needing a visual layer with the `ingest` command for
  each. Entries are paired to videos by set difference, never by URL equality —
  shared links carry tracking parameters, and giving one person's analysis to
  another is worse than producing one bundle fewer.
- **`skill install` — the skill now ships with the package.** Measured on a clean
  venv: `pip install reel-scout` produced a working CLI and *none* of `SKILL.md`,
  `commands/scout.md`, `prompts/` or `scripts/setup.py`, so an agent had nothing to
  load and `/scout` did not exist. Those assets are vendored into the wheel and
  `reel-scout skill install` lays them down in `~/.claude/skills/reel-scout`
  (`--dest`, `--force`; `skill path` shows the source). A clone still installs from
  the working tree rather than a stale snapshot. Full install is now two commands.
- **`ingest {vision,score}` — an agent can be the backend.** Keyframe extraction is
  ffmpeg, not a model, so the frames are on disk before the VLM stage runs. On a
  machine with no `oMLX`/`ollama`, an agent that can see images now supplies the
  visual layer and the craft score itself and writes them back, so the result lands
  in `show` / `view` / `inspect` / `export` instead of living in a chat log. No API
  key, no cloud, no local model. Rows are stamped `agent:<model>` because craft
  scores are model-dependent (7.43 vs 5.5 on the same clip across two VLMs), and
  `overall` is recomputed with `score`'s own weights rather than trusted from input.
  `SKILL.md` documents this as tier **L1** between web-only (L0) and full local (L2).
- **`show` now lists keyframes and the score.** Frame ids, timestamps and paths,
  with `*` marking frames that have no description yet — the ids are how anything
  outside the process addresses a specific frame.
- **One app instead of two.** The library index and the interactive inspector now
  share a single server and port — a row in the list opens straight into the
  player/waveform view. `view` lands on the library, `inspect <id>` opens one clip.
- **vulture.s shell.** `theme.py` carries the brand tokens (warm paper, warm-black
  ink, three-step rules, mono uppercase chrome) from the brand SSOT. Deviations are
  narrated in-file: a wider tool column, and no cyan (canon caps it at the tv./
  wordmark, which reel-scout doesn't carry).
- **Bundled brand fonts.** Archivo Black / Inter / JetBrains Mono ship with the
  package (78 KB total, OFL). Served as `/font/<file>` live, inlined as base64 in
  exports. CJK is subset per-export from that export's own text.
- **`export --format bundle`** — the take-home: one *self-contained* HTML per reel
  (video, keyframes, waveform peaks, fonts and a CJK subset all inlined) plus an
  index. Move it, rename it, email it — nothing to lose and no server to run.
  Verified: a bundled page issues exactly one network request, for itself.
  Reels over `--max-mb` (default 25) are skipped with a reason.

### Fixed
- `view` served requests single-threaded, so one idle browser keep-alive could
  stall the whole viewer. Now `ThreadingHTTPServer`.
- Windows console printed mojibake when its code page wasn't UTF-8 (the default on
  many machines); output is now forced to UTF-8 regardless of the console codepage.
- Re-weighting showed a contradiction at the zero-weight edge — the panel said
  "no verdict" while the overall meter still displayed the last computed number.
  It now blanks to `—` with an empty bar. (Return-value parity tests could not
  catch it; it was a DOM-state bug, found by driving the real sliders.)

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-19

> ⚠️ **Craft scores are not comparable across this boundary.** §4E changes how
> `pacing` is scored — it now reasons on measured cut rhythm instead of pure LLM
> judgment, so the same video can score differently than it did on 1.1.0. Re-score
> a video before comparing it with anything scored on an older version.

### Added
- **§4E evidence-based pacing** — `shots.py` measures cut rhythm (cuts/min, shot
  count, avg shot length) via a dedicated full-clip ffmpeg scene pass; `audio/rhythm.py`
  adds RMS energy + best-effort BPM (numpy-gated, no librosa). Stored in the new
  `shot_metrics` table and folded into the analysis so the `pacing` craft score
  rests on measured evidence, not LLM vibes. Config `SHOT_METRICS_ENABLED`.
- **§4F on-screen text (L3.5)** — `ocr.py` collects burned-in captions with
  timestamps: `OCR_ENGINE=vlm` (default) reuses the VLM's `text_in_frame`;
  `tesseract` is an opt-in engine (`ocr` extra, guarded). Stored in `ocr_captions`,
  fed into merge as an L3.5 signal layer; new L3.5 tier in the reliability cheatsheet.
- **`patterns --channel`** — per-channel pattern analysis: length, hook/CTA/structure
  mix, top-vs-bottom-half structural contrast, posting cadence. (3B)
- **`inspire --based-on [--angle]`** — generate a fresh content variant (titles,
  hook script, structure outline, length) from a high-scoring video. (4B)
- **`track --my-video --views --likes`** — record real performance and get
  deterministic structural iteration suggestions vs the top-scored corpus. (4D)
- **IG browse instaloader fallback** when yt-dlp's Instagram extractor breaks. (3A)
- **MCP tools** `patterns`, `inspire`, `research` (5 → 8 tools). (4C)

### Changed
- DB schema v6 → v9 (added `shot_metrics`, `ocr_captions`, `performance` tables).

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-17

### Added
- **Read-only viewer** for decoded analyses — two surfaces sharing one renderer:
  - **`export --format html`** — a self-contained single-file HTML (keyframes
    base64-embedded, all CSS inline, zero external assets) that opens in any
    browser, works offline, and survives being moved. Built as a take-home
    artifact for people who don't install reel-scout. `--video <id|prefix>`
    exports one video; otherwise all analyzed videos.
  - **`reel-scout view`** — a local read-only HTTP server rendering the library
    live (index → per-video pages, keyframes served by URL). `--host/--port/
    --no-open`.
  Both show each video's decoded structure (hook/beats/CTA), keyframes + what
  the VLM saw, craft scores, and transcript. Deliberately read-only — no action
  surfaces; scores are labelled a reference, not an authority.
- `db.get_keyframes_with_descriptions` (keyframes ⟕ vision_descriptions).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-17

First stable release. Completes the Batch Intelligence, Content Strategy (4A),
and Tool Hygiene milestones — the tool is now installable, CI-covered, and
feature-complete for cross-video/-channel analysis.

### Added
- **`stats`** — corpus statistics: tag distributions (content_type,
  content_structure, format, pacing, hook/cta type, emotion) + craft-score
  aggregates (avg/min/max), with `--channel` scoping, `--json`, and `--csv`
  (roadmap 3D).
- **`research --niche --channels --depth`** — cross-channel competitor research:
  lists each channel → analyzes → aggregates per channel and niche-wide → `--out`
  renders an LLM markdown report (common patterns / differentiation / strategy),
  falling back to a deterministic data-only report when no LLM is reachable
  (roadmap 4A). `--json` emits the aggregate; `--no-analyze` reuses the DB.
- **content-structure classification** — hook-body-cta / problem-solution /
  listicle / story-arc / raw-moment, emitted by the merger (roadmap 3C).
- **normalized analysis tags** — content_type / opening_type / cta_type / style
  format+pacing / emotion / content_structure mirrored from full_json into
  indexed columns for filtering and stats; migrations backfill existing rows
  (roadmap 3C, DB schema v4→v6).
- **GitHub Actions CI** — pytest across Python 3.9–3.13 (roadmap 5B).
- **MIT LICENSE** file + full PyPI packaging metadata (urls, classifiers,
  dynamic version); `pip install`-ready (roadmap 5A).

### Changed
- **`config check`** now covers all *configured* backends: yt-dlp via the
  resolved binary, LLM reachability keyed off `LLM_BACKEND`, and the optional
  audio/diarize/instagram groups when enabled (roadmap 5B).
- Version is single-sourced from `reel_scout/__init__.py` via hatchling dynamic
  version (fixes the prior 0.2.0/0.3.0 drift).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-17

### Added
- `analyze <local-path>` — the `analyze` pipeline now accepts a local video file,
  not just a URL. Registers a `platform="local"` row (`url == file_path == abspath`,
  `platform_id` = content hash, so identical content at two paths dedups) and runs
  transcribe / vision / merge unchanged. This is the platform-lockout insurance:
  when a yt-dlp extractor breaks, the core pipeline still runs on files you already
  have. Duration is probed independently and stays `None` on probe failure (no
  fabricated fallback written to the DB); a missing path raises a clear
  `FileNotFoundError` instead of the crawler's opaque "Unsupported platform".
- `compare <id1> <id2> ...` — cross-video comparison table (duration, format,
  pacing, hook/CTA type, content type, and the craft scores). Transposed table
  plus `--json`; accepts an exact id or a unique prefix; missing analysis/score
  renders as an em dash rather than a fabricated value. Pure DB read path — no
  crawler, no LLM — so it also survives a platform lockout.
- `YTDLP_BIN` config (mirrors the `FFMPEG_BIN` convention).

### Changed
- yt-dlp is now invoked via the copy pinned in this environment
  (`python -m yt_dlp`) instead of whatever `yt-dlp` is first on PATH — a stale
  PATH build silently produced baffling extractor errors. Override with
  `YTDLP_BIN`. All three crawlers (youtube / tiktok / instagram) routed through
  the new `crawl/ytdlp.py` helper.
- yt-dlp error messages surface the real failure: `ERROR:` lines are kept first
  (instead of a blind `stderr[:500]` that buried them under leading warnings),
  with a fallback to the stderr tail and an update hint when the failure looks
  like a broken extractor.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-14

### Added
- Opt-in Whisper language controls for bilingual / code-switching audio
  (中英對照 interviews): `WHISPER_LANGUAGE`, `WHISPER_TASK`,
  `WHISPER_MULTILINGUAL`, `WHISPER_CHUNK_LENGTH`.
  - Working recipe for a ZH-host / EN-guest interview:
    `WHISPER_MULTILINGUAL=1 WHISPER_CHUNK_LENGTH=15`.
  - Fixes long-form language-lock drift where whisper `large-v3` "translates"
    the guest's English into garbled Chinese. Verified on a 40-min interview:
    latin-char recovery 56% -> 90%.
  - Defaults reproduce prior single-pass behavior; leave OFF for single-language
    short-form.
- `config check` now surfaces the new `WHISPER_*` values.
- `tests/test_transcribe.py` pins the config -> transcribe() kwargs mapping.

### Changed
- `faster-whisper` floor raised `>=0.10.0` -> `>=1.1.0` (the `multilingual`
  transcribe arg the fix relies on was added in 1.1).
