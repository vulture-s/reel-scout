# reel-scout — reverse-decode a short-form video

The user hands you a viral short-form video (IG Reel, TikTok, YouTube Short). This
skill turns that URL into **structured evidence** (download → transcript → keyframes
→ VLM visual analysis → SQLite record) using the local `reel-scout` CLI, then points
the **reverse-decode prompt pack** at that evidence to answer the real question:
*why does this clip work, and what骨架 can I transfer to my own topic?*

Two halves, one contract:
1. **reel-scout (the eyes)** — gets clean, grounded input into a model: the actual
   on-screen visuals (via a local VLM) and the actual transcript, not just the caption.
2. **prompts/ (the brain)** — the 4-beat reverse-decode framework that forces the
   model to separate observation from inference, cite timestamps, and emit a
   *transferable* structure instead of a one-line recap.

## Step 0 — Setup preflight (every invocation, silent on success)

The full pipeline shells out to `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`/`yt-dlp` and needs the
`reel-scout` package installed. Verify first:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py" --check
```

**Windows note:** use `python` (not `python3` — that's the Microsoft Store stub).
On macOS/Linux either works.

On exit `0` the script emits **nothing** — proceed to Step 1 without comment. **Do
NOT announce "setup is complete."** The only acceptable user-visible output here is
remediation when something is missing.

On non-zero exit, follow the table (run the same script without `--check` for the
exact remediation strings, then act):

| Exit | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `2` | Missing `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` / `yt-dlp` | macOS: `brew install ffmpeg` + `pip install -U yt-dlp`. Linux/Windows: tell the user the install commands the script printed. |
| `3` | `reel-scout` not installed | `pip install reel-scout` (add `pip install "reel-scout[whisper]"` for transcription). Only use `pip install -e .` when the user actually has a clone — run the script without `--check` and use the path it prints. |
| `4` | Both | Do both of the above. |

Within one session you can skip Step 0 on follow-up runs — once `--check` returned
0 nothing about the environment changes between turns.

`python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py" --json` emits
`{status, missing_binaries, reel_scout_installed, repo_root, platform}` where
`status` is one of `ready | needs_deps | needs_install | needs_install_and_deps` —
use it when you need to branch on specifics.

## Surface limits — read this honestly

Two questions, not one ladder. **What can produce the visual layer** is a capability;
**how you drive the tool** is a surface. They are independent, and conflating them
tells a GUI user they are on a lower rung when their output is identical.

| | claude.ai web | Claude Desktop (MCP) | Claude Code (CLI) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Capability 0** — described, never stored | the only cell | — | — |
| **Capability 1** — you are the model; full record | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Capability 2** — a local VLM is the model | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |

**The capabilities**

- **Capability 0** — nothing is installed. The automated extraction genuinely cannot
  run, so apply the **prompt pack** to a clip the user describes or screen-records:
  `prompts/hook-reverse-structure.md` **Prompt B** is the screen-recording variant,
  with anti-hallucination guardrails. Do **not** pretend the pipeline ran.
- **Capability 1** — ffmpeg and yt-dlp are present, no local model. **You** are the
  vision backend. Keyframe extraction is ffmpeg, not a model, so the frames are
  already on disk: look at them and write your findings back. This is the common
  case for someone who just `pip install`ed, and it is a complete analysis — do not
  report a transcript-only result as though it were the whole thing. Follow
  **Step 2b**.
- **Capability 2** — `reel-scout config check` reports a reachable VLM endpoint. Run
  Step 2 as written.

**What capability 2 actually buys** is not accuracy — it is *one ruler*. The same
clip scores 7.43 under one VLM and 5.5 under another, so what a local model gives
you is every video in the corpus measured by the same instrument, which is what
makes `stats` and `patterns` comparable across rows. A capability-1 analysis is not
a lesser one; it is one whose scores should not be averaged against locally-scored
rows. (`stats` does not currently separate them — say so when you report.)

**The surfaces**

- **Claude Code (CLI)** — run the commands in this document.
- **Claude Desktop (MCP)** — same capabilities, no shell. Everything below has an
  MCP tool: `analyze` / `batch_start` / `batch_status`, then `keyframes` →
  `ingest_vision` / `ingest_analysis` / `ingest_score` for Step 2b, `show_video` to
  read a video back, `inspect` for the interactive player, `export` for the bundle.
  Where this document shows a shell command, use the tool of the same name.
  Install with `reel-scout mcp install`.
- **claude.ai web** — capability 0 only.

If you are unsure which capability you are on, run Step 0: missing binaries on every
attempt means 0; binaries present but `config check` finding no VLM endpoint means 1.

## Step 1 — parse the input

Separate the video source (URL) from any question the user asked. reel-scout
ingests Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts directly. IG profile *browsing*
needs cookies (see CLAUDE.md); a single Reel URL usually downloads without them.

## Step 2 — run the pipeline

Run the full analyze pipeline on the URL. **Pass the source verbatim, quoted.**

```bash
reel-scout analyze "<url>"
```

Real flags (verbatim from `reel_scout/cli.py`, `analyze` subparser — do **not**
invent flags beyond these):

- `--file PATH` / `-f PATH` — read URLs from a file (one per line) instead of args
- `--resume` — resume an interrupted batch
- `--skip-vision` — skip the VLM visual analysis (transcript-only; faster, no local VLM needed)
- `--skip-transcribe` — skip transcription (visuals-only)
- `--whisper-backend NAME` — Whisper backend (`faster-whisper`, `whisper-cpp`)
- `--vlm-backend NAME` — VLM backend (`omlx`, `ollama`)
- `--vlm-model NAME` — VLM model name
- `--keyframe-strategy NAME` — keyframe strategy (`scene`, `interval`, `hybrid`)
- `--keyframe-max N` — max keyframes per video (overrides the auto duration budget)
- `--resolution N` — upscale keyframes to this long-edge **px** so the VLM can read
  small on-screen text (`0` = native; this is **pixels, not a timestamp**)
- `--start SEC` — focus-window start in **seconds** (float); only extract keyframes from `[start, end]`
- `--end SEC` — focus-window end in **seconds** (float); `0` = clip end
- `--llm-backend NAME` — LLM backend for scoring (`omlx`, `ollama`, `openclaw`)
- `--score` — score the video (hook / visual / pacing / structure) after analysis
- `--skip-audio` / `--no-skip-audio` — audio analysis (default: **skipped**; pass `--no-skip-audio` to enable)
- `--skip-diarize` / `--no-skip-diarize` — diarization (default: **skipped**; pass `--no-skip-diarize` to enable)

> `--start`/`--end` are **seconds as floats** and `--resolution` is **pixels** —
> this differs from claude-video's timestamp strings. Don't pass `MM:SS` here.

Common patterns:

```bash
# Full default analysis (download + transcribe + VLM)
reel-scout analyze "https://www.instagram.com/reel/XXXXXXXX/"

# No local VLM available -> transcript + structured fields only
reel-scout analyze "<url>" --skip-vision

# Focus the VLM on the 0-8s hook, upscale for on-screen text, and score it
reel-scout analyze "<url>" --start 0 --end 8 --resolution 1024 --score
```

If `analyze` fails on the VLM step (no local `omlx`/`ollama` endpoint), re-run with
`--skip-vision` — then **go to Step 2b and supply the visual layer yourself**. Only
report a transcript-only result if Step 2b is also impossible, and say so plainly.

## Step 2b — no local model? You are the backend (capability 1)

Only when there is no reachable VLM/LLM endpoint. The frames exist regardless —
ffmpeg extracted them — so the visual layer is not lost, it just has no model
attached to it yet. Attach yourself, then write the result back so it lands in
`show` / `view` / `inspect` / the exported bundle instead of living only in this
conversation.

**No shell? Same four steps, as MCP tools.** `keyframes` returns the frame images
themselves — `show_video` only gives file paths, which are useless without a
filesystem — then `ingest_vision`, `ingest_analysis` and `ingest_score` take the
same payloads shown below as their arguments. Read the frames before you describe
them; describing frames you have not seen is the one failure this whole path
exists to avoid.

**1. Find the frames.**

```bash
reel-scout show <video_id>          # lists keyframes with their ids and paths
```

Frames live under `data/keyframes/<video_id>/`. Read the image files directly.

**2. Describe them, then write them back.** One entry per frame you actually
looked at. Address each frame by `keyframe_id`, `frame_index`, **or** `file` —
whichever you have.

```bash
cat <<'JSON' | reel-scout ingest vision <video_id> --from-json - --model <your-model>
{"frames": [
  {"frame_index": 0, "description": "hands enter frame holding a black cable",
   "objects": ["hands", "cable"], "text_in_frame": "BEFORE"}
]}
JSON
```

**3. Write the structured analysis.** `merge_analysis` needs a reachable LLM, so
on this machine it failed and the `analyses` row does not exist — meaning no
4-beat timeline, no hook type, no CTA type. That is most of what the tool is for,
so fill it in. Use the exact shape the merge prompt asks for
(`reel_scout/analyze/merger.py`, `_MERGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`):

```bash
cat <<'JSON' | reel-scout ingest analysis <video_id> --from-json - --model <your-model>
{"summary": "...", "topics": ["..."],
 "timeline": [{"timestamp": "0-3s", "event": "..."}],
 "hook": {"opening_type": "question", "opening_text": "...",
          "cta_type": "none", "cta_text": ""},
 "style": {"format": "montage", "pacing": "fast", "has_captions": true,
           "has_background_music": true, "text_overlay_count": 2},
 "engagement_signals": {"face_visible": true, "face_count": 1,
                        "emotion": "enthusiastic", "spoken_language": "",
                        "subtitle_language": ""},
 "content_type": "promotional", "content_structure": "hook-body-cta"}
JSON
```

The low-cardinality fields are **enums and are validated** — `opening_type`,
`cta_type`, `style.format`, `style.pacing`, `emotion`, `content_type`,
`content_structure`. They become columns that `stats` and `patterns` group on, so
an invented value adds a one-member category to every aggregate. Omit a field you
can't determine; never coin a new value for it.

**4. Score it with the rubric.** Read the prompt pack first — see **Step 4** of
this skill, further down — so the four dimensions mean what they mean everywhere
else, then:

```bash
cat <<'JSON' | reel-scout ingest score <video_id> --from-json - --model <your-model>
{"hook_strength": 8, "visual_storytelling": 6, "pacing": 7, "structure": 5,
 "reasoning": "cold open on the payoff; middle sags where the b-roll repeats"}
JSON
```

Rules that are enforced, not suggestions:

- **Do not send an `overall`.** It is recomputed from the four dimensions with the
  same weights `score` uses (`hook*0.3 + visual*0.25 + pacing*0.2 + structure*0.25`).
  Anything you supply is discarded.
- **`--model` is required** and gets stamped as `agent:<model>`. Craft scores are
  strongly model-dependent — the same clip scored 7.43 under one VLM and 5.5 under
  another — so a row's origin has to stay visible.
- **Values outside 0–10 are rejected, not clamped.** Fix the number; don't retry
  with a squashed one.
- Tell the user their analysis was **agent-scored**, and that those
  scores are not directly comparable with locally-scored videos in the same corpus
  (`stats` averages do not separate the two).

## A list instead of one link — `batch`

When the user has several links at once, use `reel-scout batch` rather than
looping `analyze` yourself.

**Default to the links themselves.** They are already in the conversation, and
keeping them there means the user's research list never leaves their machine:

```bash
# what the user pasted, one per line
reel-scout batch --stdin --mode agent --out ~/reel-scout-batch < links.txt
reel-scout batch --file links.txt --dry-run          # show what it parsed
```

**`--doc` is for a list you are handing *out*** — a teacher's reading list, a
shared brief. It requires sharing set to "anyone with the link", which makes that
document readable by anyone who has the URL, so it is the wrong default for
someone's own competitor research. `/edit` URLs are rewritten to Google's export
endpoints, so there is no API key or OAuth step:

```bash
reel-scout batch --doc "<google doc or sheet url>" --dry-run
```

**No shell?** `batch_start` takes `urls` directly — that is the natural shape when
the user has just pasted them into the chat. It returns immediately and the job
keeps running; poll `batch_status`, which also tells you which videos still need a
visual layer. `batch_cancel` stops it after the video in flight.

`batch` probes the backends first. With a VLM reachable it runs `full`. Without
one it **stops and offers the choice** rather than silently producing
transcript-only bundles — relay those options to the user and let them pick; do
not choose for them. If they pick `agent`, the run ends with the list of videos
still missing a visual layer and the exact `ingest` command per video: work
through them with Step 2b, then re-export to refresh the bundles.

## Step 3 — read the structured output

`analyze` prints the new `video_id`(s). Pull the full record:

```bash
reel-scout show <video_id>
```

`show` prints title / platform / URL / duration / status, the transcript, and the
analysis JSON. To list recent ids: `reel-scout list`. To dump everything for
external use: `reel-scout export --format json -o ./export` (or `--format csv`).
If you ran `--score`, `reel-scout score <video_id>` re-prints the hook/visual/
pacing/structure breakdown.

## Step 4 — apply the reverse-decode prompt pack (the analysis layer)

This is the point of the skill. You now have grounded evidence (transcript + VLM
visual descriptions + structured fields). **Read the prompt pack and apply its
framework — don't free-style a summary.**

```
Read "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/prompts/hook-reverse-structure.md"
```

Apply the **Liquid Death 4-beat 通用骨架** from that file to the reel-scout output:

1. **Hook (pattern-interrupt)** — what the first few seconds do to make the brain
   keep watching; rate intensity 1-5.
2. **反差介紹 (contrast intro)** — how this clip enters its topic vs. the genre norm;
   what memory anchor the contrast creates.
3. **CTA** — the next action it asks for; rate clarity 1-5 and alignment to the topic.
4. **結尾餘韻 (closing resonance)** — what the last 2-3 seconds leave behind.

Then produce the **transferable骨架** for the user's own topic (their Hook / 反差 /
CTA / 餘韻 by the *same logic*, not by copying lines).

Discipline the prompt pack enforces — keep it:
- **Separate observation from inference.** State what the VLM/transcript actually
  showed vs. what you're guessing. Cite the timestamp for claims.
- **Don't copy金句 or visuals — copy the structural logic.**
- If a beat doesn't transfer to the user's topic, say so and offer an alternative
  structure (per the prompt's audit rules).
- **Pacing and audio are the hallucination-prone beats** — when those matter,
  flag what you're inferring vs. what's grounded in the actual transcript/keyframes
  (see Prompt B's舉證 guardrails in the same file).

Related prompts in `prompts/` for follow-up stages (read on demand):
- `script-breakdown.md` — translate the extracted structure into the user's own shots/pacing
- `focus-audit.md` — gate the user's plan against the one thing they're selling
- `storyboard-visualize.md` — turn the approved plan into generatable storyboard prompts
- `signal-reliability-cheatsheet.md` — the 4-layer signal-reliability model (why caption-only misleads)

## Step 5 — cleanup

reel-scout keeps downloaded videos in its data dir. Per CLAUDE.md, after analysis
**ask the user whether to keep or delete the downloaded videos** rather than deleting
automatically. List paths if they want to remove them by hand.

## Security & Permissions

**What this skill does:**
- Runs `yt-dlp` locally to download the video and pull native captions (public data;
  the request goes to whatever host the URL points at)
- Runs `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` locally to extract keyframes and audio
- Runs a **local** VLM backend (`omlx`/`ollama`) and a **local** Whisper backend —
  frames and audio stay on the machine; nothing is uploaded to a cloud transcription/
  vision API by default
- Writes a SQLite record + downloaded media to reel-scout's data dir

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Does not log into any platform account or post anything (a single public Reel URL
  needs no cookies; IG profile *browsing* uses a user-supplied `cookies.txt`)
- Does not introduce new Python dependencies — it only wraps the existing
  `reel-scout` CLI and the `prompts/` pack
- Does not delete downloaded media automatically (Step 5)

**Bundled additions by this skill layer:** `scripts/setup.py` (preflight),
`commands/scout.md` (slash command), plugin manifests. The pipeline itself lives in
`reel_scout/` and the analysis brain in `prompts/` — both unchanged.

Review scripts before first use to verify behavior.
