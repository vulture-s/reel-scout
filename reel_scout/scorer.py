_SCORE_PROMPT = """You are a short-form video content analyst. Based on the analysis below, score this video on 4 dimensions (0-10 scale, decimals ok).

## Video Analysis
{analysis_json}
{measured_metrics}
## Scoring Criteria
- hook_strength (0-10): How compelling is the opening? Does it grab attention in the first 1-2 seconds? (signal: hook.opening_type, timeline 0-3s)
- visual_storytelling (0-10): Do the visuals carry the story on their own — shot variety, framing, visual information — readable even with the sound off? (signal: keyframe visual descriptions, style.format, faces)
- pacing (0-10): Does the rhythm hold attention? When "Measured Signals" are present, PREFER them as evidence: cuts_per_minute and avg_shot_sec are objective measurements of cut rhythm (higher cuts/min and shorter shots = snappier pacing), and audio_energy/audio_bpm indicate musical drive. Only fall back to the qualitative signals (style.pacing, text_overlay_count, timeline segment count) when no measured signal is given. Do not contradict a strong measured cut rhythm with a vibe-based guess.
- structure (0-10): Is there a complete arc (setup -> build -> payoff) that lands its ending? A clear call-to-action at the close is a plus. (signal: timeline narrative arc, hook.cta_type/cta_text)
