"""Batch a list of reels from a shared doc — `reel-scout batch`.

The input is a Google Doc, a Sheet, a plain URL, a local file or stdin: anywhere
a person keeps the clips they want decoded. Everything that looks like an IG /
TikTok / YouTube Shorts link gets analyzed and exported as a self-contained
bundle, one directory per entry.

**The machine decides nothing on the user's behalf.** A box with a reachable VLM
runs the full pipeline. A box without one is not silently downgraded to a
transcript — that would quietly drop the craft score, which is the part worth
having. Instead the capability is reported and `--mode` has to be chosen:

    full        local VLM does the visual layer and the score
    agent       skip the VLM; an agent reads the keyframes and writes its own
                findings back with `reel-scout ingest` (see SKILL.md Step 2b)
    transcript  transcript and structure only, and say so

`full` is assumed only when a VLM actually answers, because then there is nothing
to choose.

    # different (larger) model than the visual layer, and on a machine that
    # cannot hold both resident every per-item score forces the pair to be
    # swapped out and back in — measured at ~2.2x the per-item cycle over a
    # 9-reel batch, while the scoring inference itself is 7-10 seconds. Run
    # once at the end and the scorer loads once for the whole batch.
    #
    # The retry is not defensive padding: the first call after a batch of VLM
    # work is the one that pays the model load, and that is exactly the call
    # observed hitting the backend's timeout. The same reel scored in under two
    # minutes once the model was warm.
    # Gated on the deadline for the same reason it is gated on cancel: the run
    # was told to stop, and a scoring pass over everything finished so far is
    # not a smaller version of stopping.
