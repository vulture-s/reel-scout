"""Camera movement per shot, read from the codec's own motion vectors (§6C).

**This is a restart, not a first attempt.** The 2026-09-02 spike failed and the
roadmap records exactly why: phase correlation on a 64×64 downsample measures
*apparent global motion*, and apparent global motion cannot tell "the camera
moved" from "a large element inside the frame moved". A composited transition
scored 0.898 on block agreement and was read as a pan. The spike's own list of
what it would take put dense flow first — and ruled it out, because separating
global from local motion meant opencv or scipy, which this package will not
take on.

H.264 already carries that field. Every inter-coded macroblock has a vector, so
the decoder hands us a coarse dense flow for free: positions *and* motions,
which is what makes the two cases separable at all.

**What the measurement supports, and nothing more.** Each frame is fitted with
a similarity transform — translation, scale, rotation — over the block
displacements, and two numbers come out of it: how far the fitted transform
moves the picture, and the share of blocks that the fit explains. Those give
four states:

    moving ≈ 0, agreement high   the camera is locked off
    moving ≈ 0, agreement low    the camera is still; something in frame moves
    moving > 0, agreement high   the camera is moving, coherently
    moving > 0, agreement low    moving and incoherent: handheld, or compositing

🔴 **The fit replaced a median, and that is the 2026-09-05 fix.** Reading only
`motion_x`/`motion_y` and taking their median measures *translation* and
nothing else. The vector field of a push-in is radial and the field of a
rotation is tangential, and **both have a median of exactly (0, 0)** — so a
zoom came back as `speed 0.00, agreement 0.93` and was reported as "the camera
is locked off", confidently and wrongly. Measured on synthetic clips:

    clip              before                    after
    45% push-in       static                    camera_moves (zoom +7.1%)
    200% push-in      still_subject_moves       camera_moves (zoom +112.9%)
    51.6 deg rotate   static                    camera_moves (rot +25.3 deg)
    80 px/s pan       camera_moves (unchanged, and the fit reports zoom +0.0%)
    locked off        static (unchanged)

⚠️ **The fitted magnitudes are a floor, not a reading.** A 45% push-in measures
+7.1% and a 200% one measures +113%: the encoder codes a sub-pixel displacement
as a zero vector, so the slow end of the range is quantised away. The number
answers "did the frame transform beyond translation, and by roughly how much",
not "by exactly how much".

🔴 **`STILL_SUBJECT_MOVES` is the whole point of the restart.** It is the state
the spike had no way to name, and the one it kept misreading as camera work.

⚠️ **We deliberately do not emit pan / tilt / dolly.** `dx` and `dy` are stored,
so the direction is there for a reader — but naming a move claims the camera did
a thing, and across 585 hand-scanned shots only 7 were coherent moves at all.
Seven is not enough to earn a vocabulary. The spike shipped nothing precisely
because it was about to name things it could not measure; this ships the four
states each of which has a hand-checked example behind it (2026-09-03):

    locked off            a talking-head clip, 50 shots, speed 0.00, agreement 76%
    still, subject moves  `Wax On Wax Off` 74–78s, the composited transition
                          that fooled the first attempt: median stays 0.00 while
                          60–73% of blocks move and agreement falls to 46%
    camera moves          `yt_Zh32NmKpktI` 67.4–70.5s, speed 3.34, agreement 72%
                          — framing visibly drifts across the same scene
    unsteady              `Wax On Wax Off` shot 45, speed 12.12, agreement 3%
                          — handheld, subjects jostling, no single motion

#: than the 45% push-in's real +7.1%. After dropping outliers and refitting,
#: the pan reads +0.0% / +0.0 deg and the separation is total.

    🔴 **Seeded from the median, then grown by the fit's own tolerance.** Both

      still blocks and twenty moving 6 px — the definition of "the camera is
      still, something in frame moves" — fit a translation of **2.50**, and
      that reads out as a camera move. The median is 0.00 by majority, so
      starting from the blocks that agree with it keeps the property the whole
      restart exists to protect. Measured: seeded, the same field fits 0.00.
    - **Grown**, because a zoom's blocks *disagree* with the median by design —
      the field is radial and its median is (0, 0). Seeding alone would throw
      away exactly the signal being looked for, so each pass re-admits every
      block the current fit explains, and the inlier set expands outward until
      it stops changing.

    ⚠️ **Seeding costs magnitude, and that is the trade taken.** A 200%

    camera into a camera move, which is a claim about the filmmaker.
