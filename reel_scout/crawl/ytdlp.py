"""yt-dlp invocation helpers.

Two long-standing footguns live here (roadmap 5B):

1. Crawlers used to shell out to a bare ``["yt-dlp", ...]``, which resolves to
   the *first* yt-dlp on PATH — often a stale system/homebrew build, NOT the
   version pinned in reel-scout's own venv. yt-dlp breaks constantly (its
   extractors chase moving platforms), so an old binary silently produces
   baffling errors while ``pyproject.toml``'s pinned dependency sits unused.

2. Error messages printed a blind ``stderr[:500]``, which buries the real
   ``ERROR:`` line under leading warnings (e.g. yt-dlp's Python-version
   deprecation banner). Users saw the warning, not the 429/extractor failure.

# `h264 + opus` plays with sound, so the earlier belief that Opus-in-MP4 is
# dead on Apple was wrong. `acodec^=mp4a` is kept as a first preference anyway:
# it costs nothing when AAC is available and it is one fewer thing to be wrong
# about.

# On the library that produced this measurement, 103 of 109 files were
# unplayable, and 88 of those came through the Instagram path -- which had no
