    Shared by `scene` and `motion`. Both have the same cost shape — decode the
    file front to back applying a cheap filter — so they get the same budget
    rather than two numbers that would drift apart. It was called
    `scene_timeout` while scene was the only strategy that ran unbounded.

    Scene detection has to decode until it finds cuts; `-frames:v` only exits
    early once enough of them exist. A fixed 120s was fine while every clip was
    a reel, and impossible for a 4-hour livestream of one person talking to
    camera — almost no cuts, so the early exit never fires and ffmpeg decodes
    the whole file against a budget it cannot meet.

    Capped at 300s, and the cap is chosen from evidence rather than taste: a
    52-minute edited talk finished scene detection inside the OLD 120s budget
    and returned 38 cuts. `-frames:v` exits as soon as there are enough, so a
    clip that has cuts finds them early; only a clip that has none decodes on
    and on. 300s is therefore 2.5x what the one long clip we measured needed,
    while halving what a cut-less clip wastes before giving up.

    Capping at all is safe only because a timeout is no longer fatal:
    extraction falls through to interval sampling, which seeks per frame and
    costs the same at any duration.

    Measured for `motion` on the same fleet: a 22-minute clip's mpdecimate pass
    took 37.5s, i.e. ~35x realtime, comfortably inside the 266s this grants it.
    A 4-hour clip does not fit and falls through to interval — which is the
