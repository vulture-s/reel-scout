Duration probing was copy-pasted into three modules (`analyze.pipeline`,
`shots`, `vision.keyframe`) with two different failure policies. The
None-on-failure policy lives here so callers that must not fabricate a
duration share one implementation; `vision.keyframe` deliberately keeps its
own variant because a keyframe budget needs *some* number and falls back to a
nominal 60s rather than skipping extraction.
