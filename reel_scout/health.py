"""Corpus health — every gap in one place, each next to the command that fixes it.

Three separate times in one day this library was found holding a remedy it had
never been asked to run: a fake 0.0 score that `db check-invalid` was written to
catch, 113 clips without spans that `db backfill-shots` fills, and 102 relative
media paths that `db normalize-paths` rewrites. None of those were bugs. Each
tool worked. Nothing ever said the gap was there.

That is the same shape §4E already cost six weeks twice over, and #87 wrote the
lesson down: **a capability in use that no surface reports is indistinguishable
from one that is not in use.** Four remedies and four separate opportunities to
notice you need one is the same defect with a wider blast radius, so this is the
surface.

## Rules the report follows

* **Counts, never a bare percentage.** 100% of two clips and 100% of two hundred
  are different claims.
* **Every gap names its remedy** in the same line. A number with no next action
  tells the reader something is wrong and leaves them to guess what to do.
* **"Cannot" and "not yet" stay apart.** A clip whose media is gone from this
  machine is not a backlog item — nothing anyone runs here will fill it — and
  filing it next to work that *can* be done makes a finishable list look
  hopeless.
* **`actionable` drives the exit code, not the total gap count.** `--strict` is
  meant to be safe in a heartbeat, and a check that goes red over a clip nobody
  can fix would be turned off within a week.
