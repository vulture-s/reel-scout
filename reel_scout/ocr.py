"""On-screen (burned-in) text collection — the §4F "L3.5" signal layer.

Short-form videos often carry their message as burned-in captions / big on-screen
text rather than (or in addition to) spoken dialogue. That text is:
  - stronger than the L2 platform caption (it's IN the video, not authored for reach)
  - timestamp-alignable like the L3 transcript
  - the only textual signal for low-dialogue / pure-visual reels (the documented L3
    gap in prompts/signal-reliability-cheatsheet.md)

so it slots between L3 and L4 as "L3.5". Two engines:

  * "vlm" (default, zero new deps): reuse what the vision model already read into
    `vision_descriptions.text_in_frame`.
  * "tesseract" (opt-in, guarded): OCR the keyframe JPEGs directly — stronger CJK,
    but a heavy dependency, so off by default and falls back to vlm if unavailable.

Borrowed from crv Pro's `--ocr`; implementation our own.
