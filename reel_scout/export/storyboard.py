"""Storyboard project export — the reel-scout → storyboard-app hand-off (§6D).

reel-scout takes a finished video apart; a storyboard tool assembles one that has
not been shot yet. Both describe a clip as an ordered list of cuts carrying a
size, a duration, a line of VO and a caption — the same structure pointed in
opposite directions in time. This writes the deconstruction out in the shape the
storyboard tool reads, so "拆爆款 → 抽 SOP → 倒推自己的分鏡" stops being a thing
the course describes and becomes a file.

The interface is a data format, not a function call: neither side imports the
other. Same contract `export --format skeleton` established for smart-edit.

## 🔴 The provenance rule, and why it is not optional

A reel-scout shot is **somebody else's footage**. A storyboard `project.json` is
**what gets shown to a client as a PPM**. Once this bridge exists, "reference"
and "template" are one save apart, and nothing in the file would say which one
you are holding.

So every generated project is marked, in three places that a human cannot
plausibly miss all of:

* `meta.title` is prefixed `REF:`
* `meta.client` states it is a teardown, not an original
* **every single cut** carries the source URL and its in/out timecode in `note`

`note` is the right field for it because the storyboard app prints it and a
person editing that cut sees it. Stripping the marks takes deliberate work on
every row, which is the point — the failure this guards against is not malice,
it is somebody opening a file six weeks later and forgetting where it came from.

## What is deliberately left empty

`gear`, `scoutRef`, `scoutMeta` (sensor format, focal length) stay unset. Those
are filled by the person standing on the set. Estimating focal length from
finished footage is a guess, and a guessed number in a PPM is indistinguishable
from a measured one to everyone downstream. `imageRef` is also null: the schema
warns that field holds image data, and the representative frame's id goes in
`note` instead so it can be looked up rather than fabricated.
