"""Write externally-produced judgment back into the DB — "the agent is the backend".

The pipeline's VLM and LLM stages both assume a local model endpoint (`oMLX` /
`ollama`). Someone without one is not actually stuck: keyframe extraction is
**ffmpeg, not a model**, so the frames exist on disk before the VLM stage ever
runs. An agent that can see images can describe those frames and apply the craft
rubric itself, and this module is how that result gets back into the database —
so it lands in `show`, `view`, `inspect` and the exported bundle like any other
analysis, instead of evaporating in a chat transcript.

Two rules here are load-bearing, not stylistic:

1. **Provenance is mandatory.** Craft scores are strongly model-dependent — the
   same clip scored 7.43 under qwen3-vl:8b and 5.5 under qwen2.5vl:7b. A row an
   agent produced must stay distinguishable from one a local VLM produced, or a
   classroom ends up comparing numbers that were never comparable. Every row
   written here is tagged `agent:<model>`.

2. **`overall` is recomputed, never accepted.** `scorer.py` deliberately discards
   the model's self-reported overall because it drifts from the weighted formula.
   We apply the identical weights, so an agent-scored video sits on the same
   scale as a locally-scored one on that axis at least.

Caveat worth knowing: `stats` aggregates scores without grouping by
`model_used`, so a corpus mixing agent-scored and locally-scored videos will
blend two scales in its averages. Per-video reads are unaffected.
